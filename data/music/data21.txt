A CEREMONY at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sept. 11 offered some patriotic music and a few dabs of the classics,  but everything else made me wonder whether I should be listening as a critic or as a Christian. A lot of liturgical music these days asks you to choose between the two.With its hand-clapping, inspirational, just-folks character, how different this music is from a tradition that ran from plainchant through Josquin and Palestrina to Mozart and Beethoven, and finally to Messiaen and Britten. Without the church to inspire — not to mention finance — great composers, how diminished the history of music might seem to us.Beauty of musical color, elegance of harmony, soundness of construction and exquisiteness of originality once worked as the lure that would draw the faltering worshiper nearer. Music, as well as architecture and visual art, represented heaven to the earthbound, something dazzling and unapproachable, an advertisement for a paradise still held at arm's length.The neo-Edwardian anthems and elaborations on ethno-popular culture at St. Patrick's, on the other hand, might lead us to infer from Bach's B minor Mass or Haydn's "Creation" a certain irreligion, a seductiveness that captures the senses and leads the heart away from true communion with God. Does simple music form simple faith, arguably the best kind? Has the Dark One used great musical art to his advantage?Sophisticated music that doesn't reach out directly to its listeners — that doesn't depend on their response — bears the seeds of its eventual irrelevance. One reason classical music struggles as it does today lies with the several generations of composers in the last century who demanded that audiences understand them rather than the other way around.But music written solely for the comfort of its audience is equally irrelevant. Pushing ethnic buttons as a form of quick access to the worshiper's attention is only advertising. Easy familiarity acts like the door-to-door salesman's foot in the door, the prelude to making that sale.The Christian, on the other hand, can argue with perfect rectitude that music is just one more evangelical tool, useful Muzak to accompany the winning of converts and the reinforcement of faith. Interesting music distracts the faithful, or so this line of thinking goes. Interesting music does not tell us to be good or bad. It asks only to be admired. Getting great music and simple faith together happens, but with difficulty.Verdi's Requiem, with its visceral depiction of human fright at Judgment Day, comes pretty close to satisfying both the critic and the Christian. My nominee for the music that both thrills the senses and puts into its auditors the appropriate fear of God is the gospel singing of black churches. The sounds are amazing, and everyone in the building has something to do with making them.The church has reason to fear great beauty, hence the effort to rescue our attention, through plainspoken and deliberately flat-footed modern texts, from the mesmerizing graces of the Latin Mass or the splendid poetry of the Anglican Church's Book of Common Prayer. I am one small example, having spent the Sunday mornings of my youth in the Episcopal Church allowing Thomas Cranmer's magical imagery and liquid liturgical responses to roll off my tongue without a thought to God at all.One reason that less important music is being written for churches is that composers have other things on their minds: among them, making a living. Churches were once the center of life, and centers of wealth and power as well. Composers thrived in their employ in times when public concerts barely existed. The rich commissioned liturgical pieces as their personal upscale rapprochements with God. What money for composers circulates today is largely in secular hands.The decline in classical music and the decline of the Roman Catholic Church have things in common. Musical audiences dwindle and age; church attendance in Europe has dropped precipitously; and evangelical and fundamentalist movements in once solidly Catholic Latin America are growing exponentially. Without the divide between audience member (parishioner) and artist (clergy), rock 'n' roll, rhythm and blues, and like species so involve listeners that the audience becomes an added instrument, singing along or shouting approval. Religion in country churches is not about intransitive shows of respect but about energy bouncing back and forth.In a television interview not long ago the novelist Margaret Atwood gave as good a reason as any that a recognizably human, touchable God so engages spiritual seekers. People are lonely, she said. When they look out at the universe, they don't want to see rocks and gases; they want someone to talk to.Do we go the other way, approach God as spectators and accept religious art's tantalizing promises of a kingdom of heaven filled with nonstop Mozart and Michelangelo? Or do we sit down, take our maker by the shoulder, put beauty in its place and work things out person to person?Ritual-driven, beauty-ridden Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans may not be doing as well right now as they would like, but history keeps turning in circles, and they may have their day again.Meanwhile grab that guitar.

But her vibrant, imaginative "It's All Forgotten Now," a dance performed here in January and described as being about memory and decay, suggests that she is a choreographer with a rare feel for stage space and the ways to fill it, creating a sense of buried narrative as she goes.

(Anderson)Why is the respected Irish Repertory Theater throwing itself away on a clunky old melodrama like "Sive," John B. Keane's 1959 play about a schoolgirl from a poor family sold off by a matchmaker to a doddering old man?The group has its reasons, which Ciaran O'Reilly explains in a director's note in the program. He calls Mr. Keane "one of Ireland's unsung treasures" and suggests that this line of drama runs through Martin McDonagh today. Well, maybe, but one country's theatrical treasure may be another's homework. This solid production can't escape its good-for-you educational quality or make the play seem less dated.The pretty schoolgirl Sive (Wrenn Schmidt) lives with her dead mother's relatives: her Nanna (Terry Donnelly); her uncle, Mike (Aidan Redmond); and Mike's wife, Mena (Fiana Toibin). Does anyone need to be told that Mike's possessive mother and his resentful wife loathe each other? What's more, Mena hates Sive. "She has high notions," Mena says disdainfully, as she plots with the matchmaker (Patrick Fitzgerald) to arrange a marriage for Sive, ruining her dreams and her romance with a young man.In this all-too-familiar rural cottage, a few moments of emotional power break through. Ms. Toibin gives an uncompromising performance as the despicable Mena, allowing us to see that her meanness was bred by her own poverty and disappointments. As the matchmaker matter-of-factly states, there is no place for love in such hardscrabble lives. But those glimmers of sad eloquence don't begin to make up for the play's clunky exposition and soap-opera plot. The music and songs performed by James Barry and Donie Carroll before and during the play, in character as tinkers, add an enjoyable touch, though.If you look very hard, if you squint, you can see a connection between the harsh characterizations of Mr. Keane (who died in 2002) and Mr. McDonagh's brilliantly corrosive plays. But then maybe both writers simply observed some small-minded, meanspirited people in the neighborhood.
