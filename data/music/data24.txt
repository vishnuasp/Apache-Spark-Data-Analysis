CLASSICALFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.Opera'AGRIPPINA' (Saturday and Wednesday) This early Handel opera takes us to the world of the Roman emperor Claudius and, more particularly, his scheming wife, Agrippina, and her unrestrained ploys to have her son, Nero (Nerone in the opera), named Claudius's successor. Lillian Groag's production ratchets up the comedy, not entirely naturally: It's a kind of "Springtime for Hitler" version of "I, Claudius," with serious parts lopped out and wisecracks interpolated. The cast includes Nelly Miricioiu in the title role, Jennifer Rivera as Nerone, Heidi Stober as Poppea, David Walker as Ottone and João Fernandes as Claudio. Ransom Wilson conducts. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Allan Kozinn)'AIDA'  (Saturday and Wednesday) One of the Met's better efforts at size and spectacle returns for Saturday's matinee. Micaela Carosi (Aida) and Olga Borodina (Amneris) take over the women's principal roles. Marco Berti is Radames. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out on Saturday; $80 to $175 on Wednesday. (Bernard Holland)'CARMEN' (Saturday) Six feet tall and stunning, the mezzo Beth Clayton is a rare bird: a Carmen naturally able to project the character's tremendous power and sexiness, and incapable of the usual hip-swinging schtick. All she needs is a little more concentration on the purely musical side of things to help showcase her fine voice and turn her impressive Carmen into a great one. Scott Piper is alternately strong and wavering as Don José; Carlos Archuleta sings for the first time with the company in the ungrateful role of Escamillo (was ever a hit tune so difficult to bring off well?); and Jennifer Black brings a sweet voice to Micaëla. Joseph Rescigno conducts as if riding a commuter train along the Hudson: a routine journey through some pretty scenery. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Friday, Sunday and Thursday) This favorite double bill is still in full swing at City Opera with the new Stephen Lawless update. Here 19th-century rural Italy takes on the postwar cinematic grit of "Open City" or "The Bicycle Thief." Irina Rindzuner and Kip Wilborn in "Cavalleria" and Elizabeth Caballero in "Pagliacci" are among the new principals. Friday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland)★ 'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Saturday and Thursday) Given the success Natalie Dessay enjoyed in the title role of the Met's new production of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor," not to mention the intense promotional campaign behind her appearance, an opera buff could not be blamed for thinking that there is no reason to attend performances this week. Not so. Taking over the role is the exceptional and lovely French lyric coloratura soprano Annick Massis. The tenor Marcello Giordani is back as Lucia's lover, Edgardo, Saturday. Next Thursday that formidable role is taken over by the fine young lyric tenor Stephen Costello, who made an impressive Met debut in the small role of Arturo. Then there are the dynamic baritone Mariusz Kwiecien as her bullying brother, and James Levine, who conducts a gripping performance. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 on Saturday; sold out on Thursday. (Anthony Tommasini)'MACBETH' (Monday) Many directors stage Verdi's "Macbeth" as if it were Shakespeare, when it is, in fact, rousing Italian opera. For its new production the Met has brought in a Shakespeare expert: Adrian Noble, former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, whose experience will doubtless color his reading of a piece that is sometimes seen as one of Verdi's problem operas. One issue is that the role of Lady Macbeth is one of the toughest in the repertory; after some preseason personnel shifting, the Met is offering Maria Guleghina, who at the very least has the temperament for the part. Zeljko Lucic is Macbeth; Dimitri Pittas and John Relyea take Macduff and Banquo (each of whom gets one really good aria). And the score should be right up James Levine's alley. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Midgette)'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Friday and Tuesday) Anthony Minghella's suave and colorful production, a headliner for last year's Met season, is back, now with Patricia Racette and Roberto Alagna. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Holland)Classical MusicAMATI QUARTET (Sunday) The Amati Quartet, whose members are the violinists Sebastian Hamann and Katarzyna Nawrotek; the violist Nicolas Corti; and the cellist Claudius Herrmann, will perform Haydn's Quartet in C (Op. 33, No. 3), Schubert's Quartet in B flat and Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 2 in the Frick Collection's intimate music room. At 5 p.m., 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25.(Vivien Schweitzer)AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Friday) Offering four world premieres in one night is business as usual for this ensemble, which presents the first performances of pieces by Scott Johnson ("Stalking Horse"), Susie Ibarra ("Pintados Dream"), Steve Coleman ("The Illusion of the Body") and Ken Thomson ("Wait Your Turn"), as well as works by Anna Clyne and the great Charles Mingus. Mr. Johnson's piece, which he calls "Cubist folk music," features electric guitar, which the composer will play himself; Ms. Ibarra's calls for visual projections as well as music. Steven Sloane conducts. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 and $46. (Midgette)★ AVIV STRING QUARTET (Sunday) One of the best deals in town for lovers of classical music, the Schneider Concerts at the New School offer top-notch programs at bargain ticket prices. The series was founded in 1957 for the violinist and conductor Alexander Schneider, who served as its unpaid artistic director until his death in 1993. The new season opens this weekend with the acclaimed Aviv Quartet from Israel playing Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" Quartet and works by Haydn and Janacek. At 2 p.m., the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 243-9937, newschool.edu/concerts; $17.50; $15 for 65+; $5 for students. (Tommasini)CLARION MUSIC SOCIETY (Tuesday) This period-instrument group, which resurfaced in 2006 after a five-year hiatus, begins its 50th-anniversary season with a program of music from 1770s Salzburg. The concert, led by Steven Fox, the artistic director, includes Michael Haydn's Symphony in D and his infrequently performed Requiem for Archbishop Siegmund, as well as Mozart's Te Deum (K. 141) and Regina Coeli (K. 276). Part of the New York Early Music Celebration. At 8 p.m., St. Michael's Church, Amsterdam Avenue, at 99th Street, (212) 866-0468, clarionsociety.org; $10 to 40. (Schweitzer)CHRISTIAN GERHAHER (Friday) There must have been something in the water in the German-speaking world in the 1960s — or perhaps it was the ubiquity of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau — to make the country produce so many notable baritones who specialize in the lied. But while Christian Gerhaher has been acclaimed in Europe for his opera roles and, together with the pianist Gerold Huber, lionized for his song interpretations — their recordings of Schubert's "Schöne Müllerin" and "Winterreise" have won major awards — he, unlike many of his colleagues, has not sung often in New York. He and Mr. Huber could change that: They bring "Die Schöne Müllerin" to Weill Recital Hall on Friday. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38. (Midgette)EVALON INGOLF (Saturday) This Icelandic violinist performs Tchaikovsky's "Souvenir d'un Lieu Cher," Prokofiev's Sonata No. 2, Shostakovich's Four Preludes, Szymanowski's "Fontaine d'Arethuse" and Ysaÿe's Sonata No. 3. The concert is presented by the consulate general of Iceland. At 5:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30. (Schweitzer)★ JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Monday) This venerable American quartet has a long tradition of juxtaposing thorny new works with repertory classics. Here it plays Ralph Shapey's "2 for 5" and Elliott Carter's Quartet No. 2, framed by Mozart's Adagio and Fugue (K. 546) and the Brahms Clarinet Quintet. The clarinetist Charles Neidich joins the ensemble in the Shapey and the Brahms. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 144 West 66th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)★ LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Friday and Sunday) The excellent musicians of this self-governed orchestra have traditionally had very strong takes on conductors. But they have always had a special chemistry and regard for Colin Davis.  To celebrate his 80th birthday, and to open the Lincoln Center Great Performers season, Mr. Davis is in town with the London Symphony for three programs. The second is an all-Beethoven offering Friday, and for the final show on Sunday the orchestra will be joined by the London Symphony Chorus for Haydn's "Creation." Friday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $90. (Tommasini)NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Friday, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Alexander von Zemlinsky's 1916 opera, "A Florentine Tragedy," is based on the Oscar Wilde comedy about impotence, adultery and murder (which in this setting has an aphrodisiac effect). James Conlon has made a specialty of this work; you can hear his interpretation on a fine EMI Classics CD. With the Philharmonic on Friday and Saturday, his soloists are Anthony Dean Grifey, James Johnson and Tatiana Pavlovskaya; Jonathan Biss's performance of the Beethoven Second Piano Concerto fills out the program. On Wednesday and Thursday Christoph von Dohnanyi takes over with a program that includes Harrison Birtwistle's "Night's Black Bird," the Beethoven Fifth Symphony and the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Nikolaj Znaider. Friday at 2 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $26 to $80 on Friday; $32 to $102 on Saturday; $29 to $99 on Wednesday and Thursday. (Kozinn)ORION STRING QUARTET (Thursday) This ensemble kicks off its 20th-anniversary season and explores its development by playing the same program featured in its New York debut at the 92nd Street Y in 1989: Haydn's Quartet in C (Op. 74, No. 1), Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 2 and Bartok's Quartet No. 5. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40.

Schoenberg is also on the program. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $24 to $95. (Holland)★ PACIFICA QUARTET (Monday through Wednesday) This excellent and youthful group is presenting a survey of the complete Beethoven string quartets in a series of free "Lunchtime Concerts" in a setting that could not be more ideal for chamber music: Philosophy Hall at Columbia University. With seats for about 130 people and places for another couple of dozen more (who stand or sit atop tables), this intimate room allows you to experience these works up close.  The players discuss each work, with musical illustrations, before playing it. This week they perform Beethoven's fascinating arrangement for string quartet of a piano sonata (Op. 14, No. 1) on Monday; the Quartet No. 1 on Tuesday; and the first of the three "Razumovsky" Quartets (Op. 59, No. 1) on Wednesday. Get there early, though. Word has gotten around, and the concerts are packed. At 12:30 p.m., Broadway and 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com. (Tommasini)★ ANDRAS SCHIFF (Sunday and Wednesday) One of the most respected pianists of our time, Mr. Schiff has been immersed in the Beethoven sonatas of late. His vibrant recordings of all 32 works are being released on the ECM label, and he is performing cycles of the sonatas on tour, including one at Carnegie Hall, which begins this weekend. As an added interesting touch, he is playing these works in chronological order: the first four on Sunday afternoon and the next four (ending with the "Pathétique") on Wednesday night. Sunday at 2 p.m., Wednesday at 8, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $31 to $105. (Tommasini)THEATER OF VOICES (Thursday) One of several superb chamber choirs led by Paul Hillier, Theater of Voices offers an all-contemporary program that includes Sheldon Frank's "As I Was Saying," Luciano Berio's "A-ronne" and the premiere of David Lang's "Little Match Girl Passion," a version of Hans Christian Andersen's "Little Match Girl," told as if it were one of the Bach Passions. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Kozinn)When the Philadelphia-born Peter Orth took first prize in the 1979 Naumburg International Piano Competition, he seemed poised for a major career. Since then he has played in recital halls and with orchestras around the world. Still, for whatever reasons, he has had more success in Europe than in his native country and has been living in Cologne, Germany, since 1992.Mr. Orth has an ardent following in New York, though, as was clear from the enthusiastic reception that greeted his recital on Friday night at Zankel Hall, sponsored by the Hausmusik-Meet the Artist series. For his program Mr. Orth set the bar very high in many respects.Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109) may be the most often played of his late piano works. Mr. Orth followed this with Chopin's complete 24 Preludes, another formidable, though not uncommon, undertaking. After intermission he took on the mighty Sonata in B minor by Liszt. In playing such monumental and familiar repertory, a pianist inevitably sets himself up for comparison with a great legacy of past performances.Mr. Orth was most impressive in the Liszt, a notoriously difficult piece to bring off. Though called a sonata, this rhapsodic work is like some possessed and impulsive fantasy. Mr. Orth conveyed the music's volatility while making the score seem one long, inevitable arc of inspiration. He dispatched the cascades of octaves and knotty passage work with command.He does tend to play with very heavy-handed piano tone; even softer lyrical passages had a weighty, sometimes too thick substance. But his steely, crashing fortissimos were perfect for the Liszt. Frenzied climaxes came across with brassy orchestral fervor. That he can play with tenderness was clear during the sonata's strangely ruminative passages, exceptionally well paced and shaped here.Mr. Orth also gave a distinctive account of the Beethoven. While attentive to the work's elusive structure, he captured its mysticism and fantasy. Once in a while a fugato episode or fortissimo outburst emerged with too much thumpy brashness for my taste. Still, this was a fine performance.From piece to piece in his account of the 24 Chopin preludes, I went from being captivated by some fresh idea or wonderful color (the honest clarity of the whirling Prelude in G, the organic shape he brought to the banshee ride of the Prelude in F sharp minor) to being perplexed by some interpretive turn (the pummeling bluntness of the Prelude in G sharp minor).In his encore, "The Maiden and the Nightingale" from Granados's "Goyescas," Mr. Orth was at his subtlest and most elegant.Ernest C. Withers, a photographer whose voluminous catalog of arresting black-and-white images illustrates a  history  of life in the segregated South in the 1950s and '60s,  from the civil rights movement to the Beale Street music scene, died on Monday in Memphis. He was 85.The cause was complications of  a stroke, said his son Joshua,   of Los Angeles.Mr. Withers worked as a freelance photographer at a time when events of the day were not just newsworthy but historic occasions. He photographed the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. resting at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis  after the March Against Fear in 1966, and  riding one of the first desegregated buses in Montgomery, Ala.,  in 1956, along with the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy.He photographed a mass of men all holding placards reading "I Am a Man" at the Memphis sanitation workers' strike, the last march led by Dr. King before his assassination in April 1968. He also covered Dr. King's funeral.Mr. Withers was the only photographer who covered the entire trial of those charged with killing Emmett Till,  a  black teenager who  was said to have   whistled at a white woman. He also photographed the funeral of Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was killed in 1963, and the nine black  students   who  integrated  Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.Mr. Withers had the largest catalog of any individual photographer covering the civil rights movement in the South, said Tony Decaneas, the owner of the Panopitcon Gallery in Boston. The galley is the exclusive agent for Mr. Withers."Not only did he document civil rights history," Mr. Decaneas said, "he was the epitome of a fine-art working journalist."Mr. Withers documented Memphis's bustling Beale Street blues scene, making both studio portraits of up-and-coming musicians and going inside  the clubs for shots of live shows and their audiences. He photographed B. B. King, Aretha Franklin, Ike and Tina Turner, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, and Al Green,  among others. In 1956 he photographed a young Mr. Presley arm in arm with  B. B.  King at a Memphis club.Ernest C. Withers was born on Aug.  7, 1922, in Memphis. He worked as a photographer in the Army in World War II and started a studio when he returned.He also worked for about three years as one of the first nine African-American police officers in Memphis.Besides his son Joshua, also known as  Billy, Mr. Withers is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two other sons, Andrew Jerome and Perry, both  of Memphis; a daughter, Rosalind, of West Palm Beach, Fla.; 15 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.Besides documenting music and civil rights, Mr. Withers also turned his lens on the last great years of  Negro League baseball. His work appeared in publications like Time, Newsweek and The New York Times and has been collected in four books: "Let Us March On," "Pictures Tell the Story," "The Memphis Blues Again" and "Negro League Baseball."In a 2002 interview  in The Times, he said: "I was trained as a high school student in history. But I didn't know that I would be recording the high multitude of imagery and history that I did record."JAZZ Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.BENNY CARTER CENTENNIAL Benny Carter — the alto saxophonist, trumpeter, clarinetist, composer, arranger and bandleader often hailed in jazz circles as the King — died in 2003, a much beloved and amply decorated hero of American music. This year marks the centennial of his birth, and the occasion has been duly noted: Today is Benny Carter Day by proclamation of the City of New York, and on Friday and Saturday Jazz at Lincoln Center will kick off its 2007-8 season with Benny Carter-themed concerts. (Carter has also just joined the ranks of the organization's Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame.)The concerts should be a natural fit for the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and its artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, and not just for the usual reasons. As a repertory subject, Carter offers rich terrain: He had an unmistakable and hugely influential sound on alto; an innovative style as an arranger, both for bandstand purposes and behind the scenes in Hollywood, which he helped integrate; and a career that actively spanned almost every era of jazz. He was also a sophisticated artist with a cool but firm determination, precisely the sort of figure Mr. Marsalis is happiest to venerate.Befitting Carter's stature, both evenings will feature celebrity hosts — Brian Williams on Friday and Tiki Barber on Saturday, both on loan from NBC News — and on Saturday the program will be broadcast live on XM Radio and WBGO-FM (88.3). At 6:45 each evening there will be a free preconcert lecture by Ed Berger, associate director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University and the world's most accomplished authority on Carter's life and music. For Jazz at Lincoln Center these programs begin a typically packed season — next week, starting on Thursday, Mr. Marsalis and the orchestra move on to Gil Evans — with a crucial fanfare. If all goes well, this weekend will confirm the scale of Carter's accomplishment, and the effort required to do it justice. (Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $120.)

(Chinen)Exam   assignment for other ballet choreographers: "The program biography for Christopher Wheeldon in the New York debut season of Morphoses, his new ballet company, at City Center  says  he is 'today's most innovative contemporary ballet choreographer.' Discuss."  You can't help wondering where that leaves William Forsythe, Alexei Ratmansky and Twyla Tharp (the more so since Mr. Wheeldon includes Mr. Forsythe's "Slingerland Pas de Deux" on both programs of the City Center engagement),  let alone what  this  leaves them thinking of him.Yet let's put these competitive comparisons to one side for today.  If you want to know why Mr. Wheeldon, only 34, has become such a big deal in ballet, just check out which dancers are  appearing with Morphoses,  especially which female dancers.Before Wednesday's opening-night performance, Mr. Wheeldon appeared in front of the curtains and, with the excitable boyishness that is his public manner, gave thanks to the artistic directors of the Royal Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the Bolshoi Ballet and New York City Ballet for allowing him to use their artists.  That range of companies alone is much.But you become aware just how international Mr. Wheeldon has already become when you consider the full  Morphoses cast. It  includes  not just Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowroski, Teresa Reichlen and Wendy Whelan (four of the most remarkable leads in City Ballet's current roster);  Anastasia Yatsenko (whom  I singled out in August as the most winning performer in the Bolshoi Ballet's new  "Corsaire");  Tina Pereira and Nehemiah Kish ( both from the Canadian company); and  the Royal's Alina Cojocaru (though not on Wednesday night).  It also  features Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope (both emerging from recent retirement for the occasion), Aesha Ash (the freelance guest artist formerly with City Ballet and Béjart Ballet Lausanne) and Gonzalo Garcia (the former San Francisco principal joining City Ballet for its   winter season).Morphoses comes to City Center with live music as well, an enviable addition today, when most young companies and several distinguished old ones must make do with taped. The contributions of the Orchestra of St. Luke's (conducted by Rob Fisher), the soprano Kate Vetter Cain, the mezzo Shelley Waite, the pianist Cameron Grant and the violinist Brian Lewis would all have been enlivening even if the Morphoses stage action had nowhere been musically responsive. As it was, Mr. Wheeldon's ability to make us hear harmonies and rhythms more keenly was apparent in items ranging from the most musically conventional (namely "Dance of the Hours," from Ponchielli's "Gioconda") to the shifting and difficult chords of new music by James MacMillan (in the pas de deux from "Tryst").Since Mr. Wheeldon emerged in the mid-1990s, and in particular since the 2001 premiere of his "Polyphonia," it has been widely remarked how much he has learned from the legacies of George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton, Jerome Robbins and Kenneth MacMillan. A shame, therefore, that much of City Center's opening program suggested that he has been either learning from lesser choreographers too or failing to learn useful lessons from those four.His  presentation of women can be dismayingly passive. In the City Center opening work, "There Where She Loved" (choreographed for the Royal Ballet in 2000, here having its New York premiere), alternating between Chopin and Weill songs, and between romantic hope and disillusion, Mr. Wheeldon presents the following situations: a) if one man has a choice of several women,  he cheats on each; b) if one woman has three or four male partners, she lets all of them use and manipulate her; c) if one man and one woman are alone together,  she keeps running back for further manhandling. Ashton and Robbins, who both created Chopin ballets and whose heroines are often distinctly lovelorn, would never have presented women with so little individuality and inner life.In some circumstances Mr. Wheeldon makes something transcendent of this over-partnering. In the "Tryst Pas de Deux," Ms. Bussell is lifted up and over in a spectacular cartwheel shape to arrive in a split  across Mr. Cope's knees: she looks glorious.Ms. Bouder, making her debut in the ballerina role of "Dance of the Hours," is crystalline in its bright solo steps. She makes  her part  more applause-winning  than the man's  and further from  balletic cliché.  Ms. Reichlen  made a small role in "There Where She Loved" three-dimensional and complexly human.  In these and other passages you can see why today's international ballerinas are grateful for Mr. Wheeldon.Still, on this program he seldom looks any more innovative than Mr. Forsythe does in the pointful neo-classicism of his "Slingerland Pas de Deux," a New York premiere. I tend to find Mr. Forsythe's choreography a flashy and empty  exercise  in style, and his irksome fondness for lighting his dancers from above and behind did what it could to cast Ms. Whelan and Edwaard Liang into shadow. Nonetheless, the relation between   the sexes became striking in one extended passage of supported adagio  —  who is making demands on whom here?  —  in a way that seldom occurs in Mr. Wheeldon's work.More successful is the legato flow with which Mr. Wheeldon binds all his choreographic ideas together in each piece. Yet this is not enough to redeem "Fools' Paradise," his ballet,    new in September, for Morphoses. This dance, to Jody Talbot's orchestral "Dying Swan" (a Morphoses commission), shows men and women coexisting in a peaceable torpor that makes them look dull-witted, complacent, languorous and narcissistic, making few demands on life and getting little out of it.The most memorable step is a figure in which dancers tap an extended point in a semicircle around them, but the audience has just seen the corps do this more humorously in "Dance of the Hours." The repetition  —  accidental, you presume  —  makes Mr. Wheeldon look less inventive than limited.AROUND TOWNMuseums and Sites'DISGUISED AS CLARK KENT: JEWS, COMICS AND THE CREATION OF THE SUPERHERO' Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! Oy, it's Superman? In the seminar "Disguised as Clark Kent" on Sunday, the author Danny Fingeroth will examine the origins of the creators behind some of the most famous and enduring comic-book characters. Mr. Fingeroth, who has written a book of the same title and was an editor at Marvel for nearly 20 years, will discuss how the work of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster (the team behind Superman), Will Eisner (the Spirit) and Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (the Fantastic Four and the X-Men) and others were influenced by their Jewish heritage."I go through specific story lines, especially through the '50s and '60s that had Jewish content seeping through," Mr. Fingeroth said. Those themes include  attempts by Superman to go back in time to save Krypton from exploding. He said, "He had survivor's guilt, as did Captain America, who was frozen in that iceberg for all those years and survived his partner, Bucky." In another example Thor, a Marvel hero, was once forbidden by his father, the Norse god Odin, to marry a mortal woman. "This clearly picks up the immigrant and specifically the Jewish concern of intermarriage," he said.Then there's the X-Men, Marvel's popular mutants, whose adventures often stemmed from their otherness. The group includes Kitty Pryde, who was often depicted wearing a Star of David necklace, and Magneto, a survivor of Auschwitz. Mr. Fingeroth recalled one of that team's most famous adventures: "Days of Future Past" was set in a future dystopia in which the only mutants not exterminated were living in labor camps. "It's based on Holocaust imagery and metaphor, but it encompasses the prejudices of anybody for anybody," Mr. Fingeroth said.
