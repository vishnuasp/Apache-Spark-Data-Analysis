CLASSICALFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.Opera'CARMEN' (Saturday) Six feet tall and stunning, the mezzo Beth Clayton is a rare bird: a Carmen naturally able to project the character's tremendous power and sexiness, and incapable of the usual hip-swinging schtick. All she needs is a little more concentration on the purely musical side of things to help showcase her fine voice and turn her impressive Carmen into a great one. Scott Piper is alternately strong and wavering as Don José, and a new cast has taken over many of the other roles for the final performances of the run, which ends this weekend: Michael Chioldi is Escamillo, Julianne Borg is Micaëla, and Brian Garman conducts. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)★ 'CENDRILLON' (Friday and Sunday) A sizable contingent of opera buffs find Massenet's works musically thin and dramatically cloying. But "Cendrillon," the composer's 1899 retelling of the Cinderella story, may be the sleeper among his lesser-known operas. It's a lyrically elegant, tender and whimsical work, and is well served by the new production at the New York City Opera. The appealing cast is headed by a charming young couple: the French soprano Cassandre Berthon as Cendrillon, and the Canadian tenor Frédéric Antoun as Prince Charmant.  Renaud Doucet's production sets the tale in the 1950s, with surreal sets, garish costumes and comic antics that sometimes turn inane. Still, the wistfulness  comes through. Friday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anthony Tommasini)'NORMA' (Friday and Monday) Two schools of thought about opera and drama go head to head in the Met's revival of its John Copley production. Hasmik Papian looks the part of Norma, and attempts a naturalistic presentation of one of the most difficult roles in the repertory, but vocally she is less a commanding presence than a respectable singer at the limits of her abilities. Dolora Zajick is an old-school presence who puts singing first, and does so most impressively; to a fan of pure sound, she carries the day.  At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 on Friday, $15 to $175 on Monday. (Midgette)★ 'VANESSA' (Saturday) Samuel Barber's opera, which had its 1958 premiere at the Met, comes to City Opera for the first time. This overlooked work emerges in this engrossing performance as an authentic American masterpiece. The gothic story tells of Vanessa, an aristocratic and still beautiful middle-aged woman who has been waiting 20 years for the lover who jilted her. The entire cast is excellent, headed by the soprano Lauren Flanigan, who gives a smoldering portrayal of the title role. Anne Manson conducts an urgent, sensitive and insightful performance. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Tommasini)'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Saturday and Tuesday) Julie Taymor's quirky production of this Mozart classic is back at the Met, and if the season's first cast sounded oddly tepid, things may be looking up. Joseph Kaiser has taken over the role of Tamino, and Stéphane Degout's appealingly rustic Papageno remains in place. But the real standout in the first cast was Diana Damrau, whose portrayal of Pamina was beautifully sung and gracefully nuanced. She sings that role Saturday, but on Tuesday she switches to the Queen of the Night — sung until then by Anna-Kristiina Kaappola. Genia Kühmeier takes Ms. Damrau's place as Pamina. Got that? Kirill Petrenko conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out Saturday, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn)Classical MusicTHOMAS ADÈS (Monday) Mr. Adès is having a busy time in New York as a composer and a performer. Here he shows off his piano skills and some of his own music in a recital at Zankel Hall. Janacek and Nancarrow are also on his program. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $42. (Bernard Holland)★ ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Friday) Last spring this excellent and adventurous group  performed all 15 Shostakovich quartets in five concerts at the Baruch Performing Arts Center. Hearing these works played so compellingly in an ideally intimate chamber music space that seats just 170 was a revelation. This season the Alexander, a resident ensemble at Baruch College, is performing a Beethoven cycle, and this fourth program (of six) offers the Quartets Nos. 4, 10 and 14: one early-, one middle- and one late-period work.  At 7 p.m., 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085, www.baruch.cuny.edu/bpac; $25. (Tommasini)AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Leon Botstein and his orchestra offer four of everything, except for a game of bridge. There will be Strauss's "Four Temperaments" Waltz, "The Four Temperaments" of Hindemith and "The Four Elements" of Frank Martin. Nielsen's Second Symphony will round out the weather report. At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $27 to $55.(Holland)ARTEK (Friday through Sunday) This fine period-instrument group offers a program of Italian works by Monteverdi and his contemporaries in Venice. Friday at 8 p.m., All Saints Church, 16 All Saints' Road, Princeton, N.J.; Saturday at 8 p.m., Blessed Sacrament Church, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan; Sunday at 3 p.m., St. Luke's Church, 16-34 Clintonville Street, Whitestone, Queens; (212) 967-9157, artekearlymusic.org; $10 to $40. (Kozinn)BARGEMUSIC (Friday through Sunday) Jenny Lin opens the weekend at this floating concert hall in Brooklyn with what promises to be an eclectic, spirited recital of contemporary piano music. Among her offerings are works by Cage, John Musto, Frederic Rzewski, Robert Helps and William Bolcom. Saturday and Sunday the fare is more traditional: Mark Peskanov, the violinist, and Jeffrey Swann, the pianist, play sonatas by Handel and Beethoven. Friday and Saturday night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ on Friday only. (Kozinn)★ BERLIN CABARET (Friday and Saturday) With its pitch-perfect Viennese atmosphere,  the Café Sabarsky at Neue Galerie is a great place to hear cabaret, and one highlight of Carnegie Hall's Berlin in Lights Festival are the eight Berlin-themed evenings there. The series concludes this weekend with Robert Osborne (Friday) and Cassandra Wilson (Saturday). At 9 p.m., with a three-course dinner at 7, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org; $103 on Friday; $153 on Saturday. (Midgette)★ COLLEGIATE CHORALE (Monday) This ensemble begins its 66th season in splendid style with Mendelssohn's majestic oratorio "Elijah." The Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel lends his powerfully expressive, lyrical voice to the title role. He will be joined by the soprano Hei-Kyung Hong, the tenor Eric Cutler and the mezzo-soprano Nancy Maultsby. Robert Bass conducts the chorale and the estimable Orchestra of St. Luke's. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $160. (Vivien Schweitzer)★ ENSEMBLE ACJW (Friday) It may be hard to remember the shorthand moniker of this chamber group made up of gifted postgraduate musicians from the new training academy run by Carnegie Hall, Juilliard and the Weill Music Institute. But you are likely to remember the ensemble's concerts, since the players are top-notch, and the programming adventurous. Friday offers works for Bach transcribed for brass quintet; Ligeti's dazzling Horn Trio; and Brahms's sublime String Sextet No. 1. At 7 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15. (Tommasini)ENSO STRING QUARTET (Sunday) The cost of concerts is a real impediment for many music lovers. That's why affordable series like the Schneider Concerts are so essential. On Sunday afternoon it presents the Enso Quartet in an adventurous program: a quartet by the Austrian composer Ignaz Pleyel, best known as the founder of a piano factory that opened in 1807; a work for quartet and soprano by Ginastera, with Lucy Shelton; and Dvorak's rousing Quartet in E flat. At 2 p.m., the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 243-9937, newschool.edu/concerts; $17.50; $15 for 65+; $5 for students. (Tommasini)VADIM GLUZMAN (Sunday) This violinist offers old and new, from Beethoven to Rota and Ravel. At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Holland)★ BEJUN MEHTA AND LISA SAFFER (Tuesday) The George London Foundation appears to be spreading its wings to match the refurbished splendor of its home in the Morgan Library & Museum; its recital series this year is particularly strong. It begins with a performance by Bejun Mehta, the sweet-voiced countertenor, and the luminous soprano Lisa Saffer, two of the most respected Handelians on the scene. At 7:30 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 956-2809, morganlibrary.org; $45. (Midgette)SHLOMO MINTZ (Sunday) To celebrate his 50th birthday last month, this esteemed Israeli violinist has embarked on an international tour. Paganini's daunting 24 Caprices, the centerpiece of his program, will provide Mr. Mintz ample opportunity to display his virtuosic mettle. At 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $75. (Schweitzer)NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) Juilliard's new-music orchestra, led by Joel Sachs, gives the world premiere of Ryan Gallagher's "Sirens"; the American premieres of works by Toivo Tulev, Younghi Pagh-Paan and John Woolrich; and the first New York performance of Daniel Bernard Roumain's "Grace." At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 144 West 66th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)★ ST. LAWRENCE STRING QUARTET (Saturday) This dynamic ensemble performs as part of the Peoples'  Symphony Concerts series, which presents first-class artists at discount prices. The program includes selections from Dvorak's "Cypresses," Hindemith's Quartet No. 3 and Beethoven's Quartet in B flat (Op. 130) with the "Grosse Fuge." If their blistering performance of the "Fuge" this summer at Mostly Mozart is any indication, it should be an exciting evening. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Schweitzer)★ UBS VERBIER FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Friday) New York has surely set a record this week for the largest number of talented young musicians per square mile. The Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra made a splash over at Carnegie, and another fine ensemble plays at Lincoln Center under the baton of Charles Dutoit. The UBS Verbier Festival Orchestra, a prestigious group for musicians aged 17 to 29 that trains each summer at the Verbier Festival in Switzerland, will perform Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique" and Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3. Martha Argerich, the extraordinary Argentine pianist, is the soloist. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $85. (Schweitzer)VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Saturday) George Steel leads his superb choir in sacred works by the 16th-century English composer Robert Parsons, long one of his specialties. On the eve of recording sessions for a new collection of this music, Mr. Steel leads the choir in several of the more significant settings, including a Magnificat and sections of the First Service. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn)COLUMBUS, Ga., Nov. 15 — Radio D.J.'s were shouting themselves hoarse in the parking lot, crowing about one of the biggest concerts this town has ever seen. Cars were crawling down Veterans Parkway, trunk speakers abuzz.  The local clergy were not amused.Such was the scene when R. Kelly came to the Columbus Civic Center, here on the western edge of Georgia, across the Chattahoochee River from Alabama. Some concerts might seem anticlimactic after a buildup like that, but an R. Kelly concert consists of almost nothing but climax, one way and another. And for more than two hours he was thrilling, hilarious and downright mystifying, often all at once."They were louder in the last city," he said, baiting the crowd, even though everyone knew that there had been no last city. This was the opening night of Mr. Kelly's "Double Up" tour,  scheduled to last two months, and maybe it was organized as an out-of-town tryout. (The tour's big-city debut was set for Thursday night in Atlanta, arguably the hip-hop and R&B capital of America.) But despite a few problems with sound and momentum, this felt more like a celebration than a dress rehearsal.In any case, the tickets weren't free ($42.50 to $60.50),  and Mr. Kelly knew that his loyal but picky fans expected to get their money's worth. During an extended version of "Bump 'n' Grind," an old slow jam, he sang one of his most famous lines — "Seems like you're ready to go all the way" — and then paused, claiming that people backstage were asking him to keep things tame. This inspired a memorable digression, a fanfare for the common ticketholder.Waxing operatic, he sang: "We paid. To see. You go. All the. Way!" Then he got specific: "Hair done! Nails done! Toes done! Car washed!" He paused, steeling himself, then roared:  "Six! Hun! Dred! Dollar! Weave!" Then he issued a warning, using his own first name to amplify the threat: "Somebody say: 'Robert. If you. Don't go. All. The way. We want. Our money. Back!'" For a moment he fought back laughter, then switched moods for an afterthought:"What happens in the building stays in the building," he sang, softly and prettily. Having torn through 18 songs and snippets in about half an hour, he seemed to be fully warmed up.Like Michael Jackson, Prince and Marvin Gaye before him, Mr. Kelly sees no reason that an R&B hero can't also be an eccentric visionary; no reason that  a sex symbol can't also be, in some (or every) sense, a freak. Even in the early 1990s, when he was building his reputation with a series of aching love and lust songs, he found ways to let listeners know he wasn't like the other guys. In retrospect, "I Like the Crotch on You,"  an infamous song from his classic 1993 album "12 Play," seems like a mission statement: fair warning that he planned to push bedroom music past its logical conclusion.It hasn't just been bedroom music. At different times over the last 17 years, he has been a gospel star, an honorary hip-hop heavyweight and a comic-opera auteur. (Surely the 22 episodes of "Trapped in the Closet" are enough to earn him that last title.) As a songwriter, singer and producer, his output rivals that of any current singer, in any genre; at 40, he is still an A-list hitmaker and an unpredictable force, and "Double Up," the tour, is named after the hugely entertaining album he released in May.Right now, he also happens to be a criminal defendant: He still faces 14 child-pornography charges   in his native Chicago, stemming from a widely circulated video that reportedly shows him with an under-age girl. That scandal, which erupted in 2002, once threatened to end Mr. Kelly's career, especially since his songs don't make it easy to change the subject. He survived it in spectacular form, mainly by refusing to be cowed. If anything, his raunchiest songs got even more outlandish in the years after the report broke; what else could fans do but shrug and grin and sing along?Needless to say, not everyone is grinning. On the day of the concert here, the local newspaper The Ledger-Enquirer  printed a skeptical front-page article that portrayed the concert as controversial. The article seemed to endorse the view of one detractor, the Rev. Johnny  Flakes III, an assistant pastor at the Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church here, saying of the pastor, "He opposes the overall derogatory message that will be inherent in many songs performed at tonight's concert."This low hum of outrage scarcely hurts Mr. Kelly; it makes his whimsical sex songs seem all the more daring, while making his tributes to the fans seem all the more heartfelt.We are barely a year removed from Mr. Kelly's last traveling show, which he called "Mr. Show Biz Presents: The Light It Up Tour." While that  production suggested that Mr. Kelly was gravitating further toward musical comedy, this one is more scrambled, more bewildering, and the concert became weirder as it went on.Singing (when it counted) and lip-synching (when it didn't), he barreled through the old hits and really came alive during the parts that felt like ad-libs, even if they were rehearsed. He performed "Real Talk," an angry musical monologue, with a memorable prop: a cellphone. And he turned "Your Body's Calling" into a quiet, moving tribute to his own history, murmuring, "Somebody's still calling me, after 17 years, damn." When he used a word that Pastor Flakes probably disapproves of, he paused to ask if he should censor himself, then evidently decided not to, embarking on a loopy but elegant one-word solo.Some performers would be well advised to avoid pausing for an a cappella version of an unreleased new song, but Mr. Kelly got a huge cheer when he sang one. It helped, no doubt, that the song was dedicated "to all the big-booty girls." In mock-inspirational mode, he crooned, "Stand up." Then, inevitably, he added, " And turn around for me-e-e."He saved most of the strangest moments for near the end: a tribute to Prince (or was it a parody?); an extended jungle fantasia; a conductor skit that had Mr. Kelly orchestrating a light show. And the next morning on the radio the hosts seemed puzzled about why he closed the show with a medley of television theme songs.No doubt he'll adjust the sequencing as the tour continues. And with any luck, the opening acts won't disappoint: on Wednesday night J. Holiday and Ne-Yo appeared, but there was no sign of Keyshia Cole, who was also on the bill.By now, Mr. Kelly's track record is so long that any show will seem to be full of omissions. (This one had no "Trapped in the Closet," no "I Believe I Can Fly" and no gospel music whatsoever.) And it's no insult to say that sometimes the dancers and production numbers seemed superfluous, or that Mr. Kelly sometimes seemed to have even more stamina than the audience. As the beweaved masses staggered out, the singer was still onstage, looking ready for the next night, and maybe the next 17 years too.ALICIA KEYS "As I Am" (J Records)"It's my time," sings Alicia Keys, "it's my time to shine." This climactic assertion arrives on the centerpiece track of her new album, and it fits. Never mind that Ms. Keys, once touted as a prodigy, has been shining for some time now. "As I Am" radiates not just confidence but also experience. On the whole it's her strongest effort yet.Of course, like her last three albums — two studio releases and an "Unplugged" title, all of which hit No. 1 — "As I Am" draws inspiration from old-school soul and R&B. But especially on tracks like "Wreckless Love" and "Teenage Love Affair," made with the producer Jack Splash, and "I Need You," produced and partly written by Mark Batson, Ms. Keys explores a bright vintage sound that isn't weighted with nostalgia.Ms. Keys sings ardently throughout, favoring steady heat over pyrotechnic flash. She indulges in some righteous anger ("Go Ahead," with a contribution by Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry) and, much more likeably, in self-affirming reflection ("Lesson Learned," written with John Mayer). Her lyrics maintain a professional distance, reaching toward emotional truths that feel universal, or at least relatable.This is a good strategy, even if the specifics are what sparked the songs. The last few years have found Ms. Keys branching into film acting, supporting philanthropic causes and caring for an ailing family member. She has also deepened her partnership with the producer Kerry (Krucial) Brothers, who worked on half the album's tracks. (That's his hand on "No One," the solid lead single, and "Like You'll Never See Me Again," a distant cousin to Prince's "Purple Rain.")Ms. Keys comes closest to transparency on the tunes she wrote with Linda Perry, including "Thing About Love," the one with the line about shining. The likely anthem of "As I Am" is "Superwoman," an exhortation sure to appear soon in a montage near you. It's not the album's best piece of music (not even close), but it extends an effective invitation. As Ms. Keys has surely learned by now, no one can afford to shine alone. NATE CHINENCAM'RONPublic Enemy #1(Mixtape)Some musicians release new albums the old-fashioned way, through record shops. Some musicians release albums the new-fangled way, through the Internet. And then there's the Harlem rapper Cam'ron, whose new distribution strategy makes Radiohead seem downright stodgy. Fans who wanted to hear his long-awaited double CD, "Public Enemy #1," were told to gather outside the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Wednesday night. Eventually a Range Rover painted pink (formerly Cam'ron's signature color) pulled up, and although Cam'ron himself was apparently nowhere in sight, fans got what they wanted: more than two hours of new music on two free CDs, and a good story to tell too. Rarely has the term "street date" been more appropriate.Cam'ron is funnier and more obstreperous than 50 Cent is (or was?), and he has a similar talent for making himself the center of attention, even when he's not making music. He followed his 2004 masterpiece, "Purple Haze" (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam), with a pugnacious 2006 CD called, "Killa Season" (Diplomatic/Atlantic), which generated no real hits but kept people talking. Feuds with Jay-Z (who never responded) and 50 Cent (who did) heightened the intrigue, as did his strained relationship with Jim Jones, a former protégé.He gave an infamous interview to "60 Minutes" in April, during which he expounded upon his anti-snitching ethos, going so far as to claim he wouldn't turn in the hypothetical serial killer next-door. ("I'd probably move," he said, and who wouldn't?) His record company wasn't amused, and he swiftly apologized without recanting.Then, over the summer, he did something truly shocking: He disappeared, more or less, leaving in his wake a few cryptic online videos that prompted lots of close readings. Was he sick? Scared? Finished?"Public Enemy #1" begins with a spoken monologue that answers these questions, sort of. Cam'ron denounces the rumors. "Foolishness, buffoonery, hogwash," he calls them, with typical understatement. He also holds forth on his car collection, his run-ins with the police (he claims officers were keeping tabs on him by tracking his YouTube videos) and his summertime leave of absence. ("I had a family emergency," he says.) Word nerds and hip-hop fiends rejoice: Cam'ron is back.The new mixtape (which is widely available free online, though completists can buy a physical copy from dipsetmixtapes.com) finds Cam'ron in a relatively good mood: less exuberant than he was on "Purple Haze" but less grim than he was on "Killa Season." Now, as then, he pushes tough talk past its logical conclusion, using a gruff voice to deliver deadpan lyrics full of unexpected references and unlikely rhymes, often anchored by two stressed syllables near the end of each line.He's not afraid to repeat words if he needs to: "We drive several coupes: grape, orange, cherry coupes/Girls ball like Sheryl Swoopes, dudes hustle on every stoop." And part of the fun is the suspense of waiting for what's coming next, even if (thanks to multiple listenings) you already know: "I got my sewing kit: the streets, I done creased and hemmed 'em/Man, them buildings wasn't vacant — we condemned 'em."Like most mixtapes this one is padded out with rhymes from protégés, though Jim Jones and Juelz Santana (the two most popular members of Cam'ron's crew, the Diplomats, known as Dip Set) are conspicuously absent. Instead a handful of tracks are given over to Tom Gist and Penz, heretofore obscure rappers who reverse the usual template. On this mixtape it's the rookies who provide earnest verses about ghetto misery and the veteran who sounds brash and heedless, delivering one taunt after another.So: cut out the protégés' songs, the introductions (the second CD has one too) and the skits (one concerning excretory hygiene, one concerning cockroaches, neither unfunny), you're still left with 29 tracks of Cam'ron, which is more than enough to make "Public Enemy #1" one of the most exciting events of the hip-hop year.He clearly relishes his scurrilous image (in one song, he quotes his "Nana" delivering her verdict: "Boy, you's a hot mess"), but as usual he finds sneaky ways to encourage the thought that he's nicer than he pretends to be. "Just Us" is his version of a love song, complete with tinkling keyboards (swiped from Journey's "Don't Stop Believing") and lyrics about a woman who's trying to forget her tough life for a night. He gets her high, though he would never say it that plainly: "She said she hate a pusher, I said, 'I hate a booger — /a snotty attitude,' she laughed, I purple hazed and kushed her." And for a moment this crotchety loudmouth seems — well, he seems like a slightly-less-crotchety loudmouth. Would it be ungrateful, or greedy, to demand a new album, and soon? KELEFA SANNEH SEAL"System"(Warner Brothers)"If It's in My Mind, It's on My Face," the first song on "System," Seal's fifth album, starts out like a sequel to his lofty mid-1990s rock anthems like "Kiss From a Rose." Misty, hymnlike chords waft around him, and U2 guitars ping as Seal vows, "Wish I could take you to a better place." But then a drum-machine beat kicks in, signaling that on this album Seal is taking his aspirations to the dance floor — or back to the dance floor. After all, Seal started his career singing dance tracks before turning toward rock for his definitive mid-1990s hits.For "System" Seal chose the producer Stuart Price, also known as the club-music auteur Jacques Lu Cont and as Madonna's collaborator for her "Confessions on a Dance Floor." Mr. Price's head-bobbing beats keep things smiley-faced whether Seal is proffering love and compassion, or bemoaning the way things fall apart. "There's silence every day because there's no way I can save you," he sings in "Dumb," amid hand claps and synthesizer blips.He never stays unhappy for long. Seal is out to save or comfort everyone, including himself. With the grainy, gospelly sound of his voice, Seal sympathizes with unhappiness and uncertainty, and then wills himself and his listeners toward optimism. "I want you to always feel you're amazing," he insists in his best life-counselor mode on the single "Amazing." He's still celebrating his marriage to the model Heidi Klum, who sings a duet with him on "Wedding Day," while in "Immaculate" he extols their interracial union: "feather-white skin and ebony."But Seal is better when he's ambivalent, suspended between misery and his mission of solace, as he is in "Loaded," sketching an unresolved romance with anguished vocals over a pulsating beat. For most of "System," the indefatigable drum thumps and whizzing keyboard tones prevent Seal from getting too vaporous, while all his yearning comes through. JON PARELES CARLA KIHLSTEDT and SATOKO FUJII"Minamo"(Henceforth)On "Minamo" the violinist Carla Kihlstedt and the pianist Satoko Fujii ply the craft of post-jazz musicians all over the world: live, free-improvisation duets. Most records like this imply that the two musicians rarely get a chance to play together. (If they did, they might invest in the partnership more: write some music, book a studio, set up a Web site for the project, give it a name.) And some are perfunctory, of course. But not this one. "Minamo" is extraordinary, a series of tight, dramatic events.Both Ms. Kihlstedt, who lives in California, and Ms. Fujii, who lives in Japan, have conservatory backgrounds. Both eventually threw themselves into non-genre-specific writing and improvising, drawing on rock, Cecil Taylor, Bartok and much else; you're more likely to find them in a jazz festival than any other kind. (Ms. Kihlstedt is a member of the bands Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and 2 Foot Yard; Ms. Fujii leads her own trio, quartet and orchestra.) They performed together onstage in 2002 and 2005, in San Francisco and in Wels, Austria, and this disc captures both concerts.Even without written music the musicians have plenty of ground under their feet: vamps, patterns, echoed motions. Both play with virtuosic precision and a great range of technique, even when the music becomes gestural and built on hummingbird pulses, glassy wipes of the violin strings, dark rumbles of rubbed piano strings. The whole record, but especially the second concert, runs on its own vivid tension.

(914) 962-5758; www.yorktownstage.org."Hamlet," of course, involves a fair amount of emotional turmoil and transformation. So you may not be the right performer for it if you have a particularly wooden countenance. If you are, for instance, a marionette.That is one of the things working against this version of the play being staged by the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater: The actors never quite overcome the fact that they used to be trees. Another is the carousel. It tends to steal the show.Yes, the marionettes perform on and in front of Jane's Carousel, a gorgeous machine dating to 1922 that is now biding its time in a warehousey building on Water Street in Brooklyn. Sometimes the carousel is in motion, sometimes not. But its horses, with their expressions of alarm and urgency, often seem more into the play than the stone-faced marionettes performing it.Those marionettes are handled by fully visible humans, who speak the dialogue and do as much as actors can when forced to carry large chunks of wood at all times. But never mind; this is not a "Hamlet" for people who are actually interested in seeing "Hamlet."  (It is also, by the way, not a particularly child-friendly "Hamlet," despite the carousel. No one not already familiar with the play would be able to make out the story from this pared-down version.) It is for people who a) like marionettes, or b) have an appetite for oddity but couldn't get tickets to the Wooster Group's "Hamlet," which has no carousel but has Richard Burton, who is dead.Anyway, it's a performance you watch for the visual and aural moments when the various elements mesh. Most of these occur late in the play, after the killing starts. The carousel is revved up, the music (played live by Clifton Hyde on an assortment of instruments) grows more insistent, and you begin to see what Vit Horejs and Pavel Dobrusky, the directors, had in mind. When, as happens several times, the carousel carries a character inexorably away from the unfolding tragedy, it's a perfect image. Think of any classic nightmare in which you can see something awful happening but are somehow unable to intervene."Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" runs through Nov. 25 at Jane's Carousel, 56 Water Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn; (212) 868-4444.
