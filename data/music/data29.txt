People heard him before they saw him, mumbling — croaking, really — in a low voice that seemed to come from nowhere. "Is the show starting?" Then: "Hold up, hold up." Then, seemingly to an assistant: "I don't want to fall." This was good news. It was Tuesday at the B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, and Sly Stone was in the building.He is 64 now, and his best songs — exuberant and sometimes unsettling funk hits and experiments from the late 1960s and early '70s — haven't aged a day, though the same can't quite be said of the guy who sang them. He hasn't released an album of new material in nearly a quarter-century, and his occasional live shows have sometimes made fans wish they were even more occasional. He has largely avoided the public eye, and his 1987 arrests and a 1989 conviction for cocaine possession hardly encouraged optimism.Last year the urban myths became a public spectacle at the Grammy Awards, during an odd performance that had been rumored to be the start of his latest comeback. After a five-minute tribute (featuring Fantasia, members of Aerosmith and others) he made an impressive entrance, sang a little bit of "I Want to Take You Higher" and wandered offstage before the song was finished.So no one who came to his show Tuesday night could claim ignorance. With Sly Stone, in 2007, you take what you get.When he finally emerged for the first of two scheduled sets, he shuffled to the microphone, hunched over but spry, as he proved when he did a playful little jump. A shouted question from the crowd: "How you doing, Sly?"The witty response: "Eh ..."Then came band introductions, which were cut short ("We got two shows tonight, so everybody just come onstage," he said), and an onstage interview. As the crowd got restless, a man clutching a sheet of paper tried to read questions for Mr. Stone. Had he ever been arrested? "I've been arrested for armed robbery," he said before trailing off.He delivered some tantalizing rap verses, a cappella: "You can't face a noun so you're straight adverbing it/Had an argument at home, and you had to have the last word in it." (According to a recent feature in Vanity Fair the verse comes from a new song, "We're Sick Like That.")Acutely aware of the time crunch — it was now after 9 p.m., and the second show was scheduled to start at 10:30 — a few people started shouting, demanding that Mr. Stone play a song. And he obliged, sort of. The band (a revamped version of Sly and the Family Stone, including the original saxophonist, Jerry Martini; the original trumpeter, Cynthia Robinson; and the singer Lisa Stone, the daughter of Mr. Stone's sister and sometime bandmate, Rose Stone) struck up "Dance to the Music," and there was a big cheer.Only one problem: Mr. Stone was gone, although if you were standing in the right place, you could see he hadn't gone far. He was there in the wings, nodding along with the music. And he remained there too for "Everyday People." Finally he returned for "I Want to Take You Higher," flashing the victory sign (or was it the peace sign?) every time he sang the word "higher."Which is to say: He did sing, sporadically, and sometimes quite well, using something close to the eerie, insinuative voice that can be heard on "There's a Riot Goin' On," his astonishing 1971 album. The highlight, by far, was a slithery version of "If You Want Me to Stay" from his 1973 album, "Fresh," in which he peeled off two perfectly loopy talk-box solos while delivering the lyrics, which sounded more bittersweet than ever: "Count the days I'm gone/Forget reaching me by phone/Because I promise I'll be gone for a while."Then, during "Sing a Simple Song," he excused himself, saying he had to urinate. His band killed time until he returned for "Family Affair," ending it with an excuse: "There's two shows tonight, and sometimes you gotta get off the stage."That's what he did, though he came back to reprise "I Want to Take You Higher" and then left before "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," which sounds a bit different when the message is delivered in absentia, by backup singers.Perhaps this wasn't quite what fans had hoped for, but it's exactly what they had paid their $103.35 (including fees) for: a glimpse of something great. The grumbling began before the house lights came on, and outside on 42nd Street fans gave their concert reviews to the people standing in line for the late set. One man could be overheard gruffly denouncing the show as "nonsense," and worse. A friend asked if he planned to sell the tickets he had already bought for Mr. Stone's next scheduled New York concert, at the same club on Dec. 7. And without missing a beat, the man said no. He'd be going. Just in case.Leftovers? For the holidays? That's one way to look at this year's crop of boxed sets. Now that most pop careers have already been distilled to a handful of discs, culling has given way to expansion. Musicians and labels are combing archives for outtakes, alternate versions, videos and other curios, rewriting pop's past and revealing how good — or how misguided — the original selection process was. And many of the leftovers deserve their second chance. JON PARELESHere are CD boxed sets, of three or more discs, recommended by the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times. A selection of smaller greatest-hits collections and reissues will appear on Dec. 7.CITY OF DREAMSA Collection of New Orleans MusicBefore Hurricane Katrina, a lot of New Orleans music was cozily insular and suffused in local lore, mingling tradition and nostalgia. The New Orleans aficionados at Rounder Records have recorded more than 100 albums there since the early 1980s, with musicians who were already elders — including the pianists Professor Longhair and James Booker and the singers Irma Thomas (above) and Johnny Adams — and younger ones carrying on traditions like brass-band music and Mardi Gras Indian songs."City of Dreams" includes a few vintage R&B singles. But it's mostly a survey of what visitors could hear in recent decades in clubs, at Mardi Gras or at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. The label recorded working musicians steeped in the city's rolling, chattering second-line rhythms and its casual, intuitive notion of ensemble unity.This is by no means a definitive New Orleans collection; it's strong on pianists (with one CD of solos) and older R&B singers, adequate on brass bands, stretched thin on funk. But in its informal way "City of Dreams" picks up the spirit of a unique local scene that took its continuity for granted. Two years after the levees failed, with the city still depopulated, that continuity is in question. (Rounder Records. Four CDs. $32.98.) JON PARELES THE BRIT BOXNot so long ago, boxed sets seemed big, sometimes intimidatingly so: hours and hours of music, all in one place! Nowadays the problem is that they seem laughably skimpy; bulky, too. You get a doorstop the size of a shoe box containing a few hours of music — that's a fraction of the capacity of an iPod nano, which is the size of a few business cards. Increasingly, it seems, the main draw is the booklet or sometimes the physical box itself.Certainly that's the case with "The Brit Box," a "comprehensive survey of U.K. indie music" that's basically a lively (and very readable) booklet full of reminiscences and brief biographies, with a four-CD mixtape thrown in. (Also a suitably silly gimmick: the telephone booth on the cover lights up.) If you're really curious about how the aftershocks of punk and new wave congealed into a 1990s British rock resurgence that straddled the underground and the mainstream, you could probably learn — and hear — more by going online and exploring Wikipedia, YouTube and a few hundred other sites.But if you want something you can hold, you could do worse than this compilation, which includes obscure but justly beloved forebears (Felt, Shop Assistants), mainstream juggernauts (like Oasis, above, and Blur; without them  this box probably wouldn't exist) and plenty of bands that seized the British spotlight (however briefly) without ever making a ripple in America. (Rhino. Four DVDs. $64.98.) KELEFA SANNEH THE ART OF FIELD RECORDING, VOL. 1Every day the past of American music has a better future. Four years ago the Dust to Digital label put out "Goodbye, Babylon," which some called the greatest anthology of American gospel music ever assembled. Now the label, based in Atlanta, has produced "The Art of Field Recording, Vol. 1," four extraordinary discs culled from tapes recorded by Art Rosenbaum, a professor of art at the University of Georgia who has pursued musicology as a 50-year sideline.Obviously it isn't definitive; it's just one man's work. But it's a gold mine, an ark. There are string bands, acoustic blues, ring shouts, "hambone" chants, Sacred Harp and Georgia Sea Island singing, the "lined-out" hymnody of Southern churches, unaccompanied fiddlers and banjoists and jew's-harpists. A great deal of it is spooky and blindingly beautiful, and the set owes its power to Mr. Rosenbaum's judicious ear. Almost all of these performers, often recorded in their homes or churches —  including members of the W. B. Thomas Gospel Chorus, above — transcend the clichés of their style. There will be more: Volume 2 arrives next year. (Dust to Digital. Four CDs. $69.98.) BEN RATLIFF JOHN COLTRANEInterplayThese 1956-58  recordings are from Coltrane's years with Prestige Records,  when his discography becomes a spaghetti junction of sideman jobs, cooperative bands, jam sessions and the occasional session as leader. The Coltrane-as-leader sessions came out last year in their own boxed set; this set presents Coltrane with others, taken from records like "Cattin' With Coltrane and Quinichette" (with the saxophonist Paul Quinichette) and "Tenor Conclave" (with Hank Mobley, Al Cohn and Zoot Sims). There's a lot of round-robin soloing, and the sense of purpose is diluted, of course: even in Coltrane's own playing we don't hear the focus of later years and better albums. But these are still beautiful examples of the casual late-'50s jazz recording session, with pockets of exceptional post-bop playing that has usually gone underrecognized. (Prestige. Five CDs. $59.98.) BEN RATLIFF MILES DAVISThe Complete 'On the Corner' SessionsThis music — recorded a few years after "Bitches Brew" and a few more long steps away from traditional jazz — is very heady and doesn't reduce very easily. Here's a warning: Do not give it to a person who only knows that he or she likes the Miles Davis of "Kind of Blue." But if that person likes funk, and has a fairly deep attention span, then this might be a Xanadu. These jam sessions and collages were made with a changing cast that usually included the electric bassist Michael Henderson and the drummer Al Foster; they build on African and Indian music and some of the compositional ideas of Karlheinz Stockhausen. They're dense and tense, gnashing and clashing, and utterly great. (Sony Legacy. Six CDs. $139.98.) BEN RATLIFFGENESIS1976-19821983-1998Starting with "A Trick of the Tail," from 1976, these sturdy boxes include jewel-case versions of all nine of Genesis's post-Peter-Gabriel albums, each paired with a DVD of interviews and videos. Each box also includes a hardcover book, with a CD and a DVD of extras and stray tracks. When you listen to it all, it's hard not to be struck anew by the long evolution from precious prog-rock to playful new wave, and by the band's commercial success in the 1980s. Back then it seemed reasonable (though now it seems unimaginable) that a band formed in 1967 might be reborn as a Top 40 juggernaut. (Rhino. "1976-1982": Six CDs, six DVDs. $129.98. "1983-1998": Five CDs, five DVDs. $99.98.) KELEFA SANNEHLUIZ GONZAGAMonumento NordestinoForró, the bouncy accordion-and-triangle-driven music of rural northeastern Brazil, gained a nationwide audience through Luiz Gonzaga (1912-89). He found a following among homesick northeasterners in Rio de Janeiro, then became a radio phenomenon, staying folksy while reaching out. His voice is always kindly, and songs he wrote, like "Asa Branca," became Brazilian standards. These CDs are from his 1940s and 1950s peak: two exploring the variety within his forró, the third trying other styles, from samba to mazurka. The DVD is a concert and documentary from 1984, showing his jovial presence, some admiring star guests and his cheerful determination to bring hope to his hard-working countrymen. (Sony BMG Brasil. Three CDs, one DVD. $78.99.) JON PARELES  MERLE HAGGARDLegends of American Music: The Original OutlawMerle Haggard knew early on the kind of characters he wanted to sing about: convicts, salt-of-the-earth workingmen and hard-drinking fools for love. He also forged country music that could swing, twang and stay heartfelt. This straightforward, unflashy compilation covers his whole career, from attempts at country-crooner singles through swinging honky-tonk to his craggy latter-day reflections about his beloved America going wrong. (Time Life. Three CDs. $39.98.) JON PARELESEMMYLOU HARRISSongbird: Rare Tracks and Forgotten GemsEmmylou Harris has already compiled her hits for another box. This miscellany, spanning the years from 1970 to 2006, pulls together collaborations (from singing backup with Gram Parsons to joining Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Beck and the Pretenders), outtakes (including some from her trio with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt) and live tracks. In her long career Ms. Harris has played both to and against the purity of her reedy soprano. The songs she chose for this set move from devout sincerity, mountain fingerpicking and gospel conviction to loneliness and mourning, with electric guitar underlining the end of innocence. (Rhino. Four CDs and one DVD. $74.98.) JON PARELESHEAVY METALYou can't win putting heavy metal in a box. It's too loud and large and profane and multinational; in the end, sort of like jazz, it means too many things. You have to go deep with metal's subgenres; that's why they exist. This is a speed tour through the major metal bands from 1968 to 1991, one song each, from Iron Butterfly to Sepultura.  There must have been licensing complications, because this is a metal canon without any early Black Sabbath. (Rhino.  Four CDs. $64.98.) BEN RATLIFFROBYN HITCHCOCKI Wanna Go BackwardsWith lyrics hovering between revelation and doggerel, and tunes that prize both the concision of mid-1960s rock and the playfulness of psychedelia, Robyn Hitchcock's songs mingle strangeness and clarity. This set reissues, and adds outtakes to, solo albums from the early 1980s — "Black Snake Diamond Role," "I Often Dream of Trains" and the stripped-down "Eye" — that seesaw between flippancy and ache. Two discs of demos, including some songs he never revisited, are even more exposed. Wry as the songs might be, no one could mistake them for mere whimsy. (Yep Roc. Five CDs. $39.99 download, $49.99 CD, $99.99 vinyl.) JON PARELESJAZZ ICONS: SERIES TWO BOXThe producers of the "Jazz Icons" DVDs aren't just hurling any old footage at the consumer. These are excellent performances by John Coltrane, Sarah Vaughan, Dexter Gordon, Wes Montgomery, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Dave Brubeck, from the prime of their careers. And they're beautifully shot, mostly filmed for European television. They include a previously unreleased performance by Coltrane, with Stan Getz; a superb Montgomery show with some between-song conversations (red alert, guitar freaks); and heartbreakingly good Vaughan. It's almost guaranteed that you'll understand these artists better by watching them work in these films. (Reelin' in the Years/Naxos. Six DVDs. $95.99.) BEN RATLIFFLOVE IS THE SONG WE SING: San Francisco Nuggets 1965-1970Excavating the Bay Area epicenter of American psychedelia, this knowledgeable compilation sets the essentials — Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Santana, Moby Grape — in the context of a scene that still sounds hopped-up and utopian. Folk-rock melts down with blues, soul, jazz, raga and noise, not just in well-known songs but also in artifacts from little-remembered bands like the Mystery Trend, the Front Line and Fifty Foot Hose. "Oh, this can't last," the band Kak sang in "Lemonaide Kid," and money, politics and drugs ensured that it didn't. But this set captures the fragile cultural moment. (Rhino. Four CDs. $64.98.) JON PARELES MAGNOLIA ELECTRIC CO.SojournerThis wooden box isn't ancient history: it compiles the results of the four recording sessions (one solo) that  Jason Molina drew on for "Fading Trails," an album released by his band, Magnolia Electric Co., in 2006. (He used to record as Songs: Ohia.) Mr. Molina is known for melancholy indie-rock, but this box documents his deepening fascination with old-fashioned country and soul, and his decision to release the full recording sessions seems both generous and shrewd. Indie fans are obsessive, and they don't mind rummaging through dozens of tracks to find their favorites; shouldn't more bands be doing this? (Secretly Canadian. Four CDs, one DVD. $37 from secretlycanadian.com.) KELEFA SANNEH JOE MEEKThe EP Collection"This is a strange record, I meant it to be," the producer and composer Joe Meek wrote in the liner notes of "I Hear a New World Part 1," one of the 12 four-song EPs from the early 1960s reproduced in this boxed set. Ten were productions for others, including the Tornados; he wrote their hit "Telstar." Mr. Meek, who committed suicide in 1967, used colossal reverb, wordless voices, detuned instruments and other effects that turned pop hokum into grandiose, kitschy mini-epics. None is nuttier than his own "I Hear a New World," a two-EP stereo extravaganza and "outer space music fantasy" full of abstract noises made with prosaic means. But his treatments of more conventional songs for the Tornados and an English country singer, Houston Wells, come close. (Castle. 12 CDs. $59.98.) JON PARELESPENTANGLEThe Time Has Come: 1967-1973More freak-folk fans should rediscover Pentangle's pristine and unlikely meld of traditional ballads and acoustic jazz: Jacqui McShee's airy soprano, the gnarled guitar mesh of Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, the elegantly syncopated counterpoint of Danny Thompson on bass and Terry Cox on drums. This set is for already committed fans; its collector mentality prizes rarity over quality, resurrecting singles and two CDs of live performances that are more earthbound than Pentangle's studio gems. Newcomers can start with the albums "Basket of Light" and "Cruel Sister" instead. (Castle. Four CDs. $59.98.)  JON PARELESPEOPLE TAKE WARNING!Murder Ballads & Disaster Songs, 1913-1938For those of a certain cast of mind, the song of the Titanic is not "My Heart Will Go On," by Celine Dion, from 1997; it is "Titanic Blues," by the reedy-voiced medicine-show singer Richard (Rabbit) Brown, from 1927. "You know they stood out on that sinking deck/And they was all in great despair," Brown sang. "You know accidents may happen most any old time/And we know not when or where." All the American music here, by black and white singers, lavishly devotes itself to calamity and logically separates into three discs: "Man v. Machine," "Man v. Nature" and "Man v. Man (and Woman, Too)." It's the poetry of the police blotter, the violent myth, the unthinkable famine, flood, flu or tornado. (Tompkins Square. Four CDs. $46.99.) BEN RATLIFFTROJAN SLACK REGGAE BOX SETSlack means sexually explicit, so scolds and subversives beware: this is what often happens to pop songs that people consider offensive. They get  more charming with age, until they come to seem like harmless mementos from an earlier era. Certainly it's hard to imagine this compilation — which follows a similar one from 2002, "Trojan X-Rated Box Set" — inspiring anything but fond smiles from the people who hear it. The price (cheap) matches the packaging (bare-bones), the song selection (haphazard) and the sequencing (seemingly random). But it's hard not to enjoy reggae singers and chatters from the 1980s and 1990s, ranging from Max Romeo to Yellowman to Ce'Cile to Beenie Man, all gleefully delivering lyrics that you won't be reading in these pages. (Trojan/Sanctuary. Three CDs. $21.98.) KELEFA SANNEH IKE AND TINA TURNERThe Ike and Tina Turner Story: 1960-1975Song after song on "The Ike and Tina Turner Story" sketches the same predicament: a powerhouse of a woman in thrall to a man she shouldn't trust. Tina Turner worked her great raspy voice to the edge of hysteria; the music, shaped by Ike, swaggered with ideas from New Orleans R&B, Memphis soul, rock and, eventually, funk. Only later would Ms. Turner's autobiography reveal how realistic the songs were. Two CDs collect the hits (with a supercharged live substitute for Phil Spector's production of "River Deep, Mountain High"). The third reissues a 1969 live album that, unfortunately, concentrates on cover versions. (Time Life. Three CDs. $39.98.) JON PARELES LUTHER VANDROSSLove, LutherLuther Vandross, who died in 2005, sang the most polished, luxurious soul: grown-folks' music, as the liner notes to this set put it. And while glossy sentiment made a lot of his music sound dated — the dewdrop synthesizer tones, the metallic drum sounds — his singing is so refined, his songs so single-mindedly devoted to the idea of perseverance and redemption, that the trappings don't matter. This box tracks his movements from disco's waning years, as the singer in the bands Luther and Charme, through his own albums, his duets with Mariah Carey and Beyoncé, and finally his last record, "Dance With My Father," which climbed the charts as he lay incapacitated by a stroke. (Epic/J Records/Legacy.  Four CDs. $49.98.) BEN RATLIFFVEE-JAY The Definitive CollectionThe Vee-Jay label lasted from 1953 to 1966 and released America's first Beatles singles, not included on this set. But Vee-Jay's homegrown blues, doo-wop, gospel and R&B — recorded with no frills but plenty of spunk — encompassed hits from Jimmy Reed, the Dells, Betty Everett, Jerry Butler, John Lee Hooker and the Spaniels, and gutsy non-hits by acts like Sheriff and the Ravels and Gloria Jones (the original "Tainted Love"). Vee-Jay had no signature sound, just good ears. (Shout! Factory/Vee-Jay. Four CDs.  $59.98.) JON PARELES CELINE DION"Taking Chances"  (Columbia)It has now been a decade since Celine Dion first shared the musical electrocardiogram that has come to define her career. And in retrospect "My Heart Will Go On" seems like the end of an era. Since then she has managed only one more Top 10 hit in  the United States: "That's the Way It Is," from 1999. Her hugely successful residency in Las Vegas is testament to the size and devotion of her fan base, but it may also have fostered the impression that Ms. Dion has become an oldies act.Not true! In this decade alone Ms. Dion has released five albums of new songs, three in English, two in French; her CDs still routinely top the charts in France, Belgium and, of course, her native Canada. Now comes the sixth, "Taking Chances," which starts simply enough, with the title track, with a strummed guitar and an absurd plea: "Don't want to be alone tonight, on this planet they call Earth." (By the way that last prepositional phrase, portentous and meaningless, can be tacked onto just about any lyric in need of extra oomph: "Sweet home, Alabama, on this planet they call Earth"; "You lived your life like a candle in the wind, on this planet they call Earth"; "We be big pimpin', on this planet they call Earth.") Before long the music is swelling, giving Ms. Dion a chance to do what she does best: soar.She's easy to mock because she's so uncool, or rather, unchilly. She belts out those fervent ballads with a singular combination of confidence (she knows she can nail every note), recklessness (she's not afraid to overdo it) and unpretentiousness (she sees no shame in giving people what they want). This combination helps explain her overloaded release schedule, and it also helps explain her new CD. Eager to put herself back in the American pop mainstream, she recruited a wide range of big-name collaborators: the R&B singer Ne-Yo; the songwriters Linda Perry and Kara DioGuardi; the producer Christopher (Tricky) Stewart, of "Umbrella" fame; that guy who used to be in Evanescence.The results can be gruesome. "Eyes on Me," an awkward club track, sounds like Shakira covering Beyoncé's "Baby Boy." And "That's Just the Woman in Me" is truly puzzling: a melodramatic blues-rock song, with lyrics that sound no less bizarre when delivered in Ms. Dion's French-Canadian approximation of a  Deep South accent. (There isn't a drawl thick enough to redeem, "Searching for that imperious, mysterious, femme fatale kind of stuff.")O.K., so it's obvious that chances have been taken. But most of the best songs here are the safest. "I Got Nothin' Left," the one Ne-Yo helped write and produce, is a beautiful lament, sung by Ms. Dion in the smallest voice she can muster, which is still pretty big. "Shadow of Love" is a pounding Euro-pop song that's cheerfully inane, in the best sense. And "Surprise Surprise," a sweeping power ballad that's satisfying because it follows the rules: from the second the strings kick in you know a triumphal modulation is coming. KELEFA SANNEHTHE HIVES"The Black and White Album" (A&M/Octone)Sweden exports a lot of high-concept retro-rock, from glam (the Ark) to psychedelia (Dungen) to the garage rock of bands like Mando Diao and the Hives.On their first albums the Hives apparently aspired to have their raucous, vintage-sounding songs mistaken for tracks from the mid-1960s garage-rock collection "Nuggets." Now the Hives have decided to loosen the concept. "If same-ing isn't working, why don't you different instead," Howlin' Pelle Almqvist taunts in "Try It Again."Now the Hives allow songs to stretch past three minutes (but still under four), and occasionally to slow down. They've moved from low-fi, near-mono production to cleaner, deeper-bottomed stereo, adding tinges of metal and power pop to their garage rock. The Hives recorded most of the album in Mississippi at Sweet Tea studios, where Elvis Costello and Buddy Guy have also made albums with the house producer, Dennis Herring, and two songs were produced by none other than Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes. Now and then keyboards and female backup singers join the guitars and drums, while the Hives also reveal that they've heard some Clash, Sex Pistols and Devo.The Hives haven't gotten any less rowdy. They're still fighting with girlfriends and, often, the rest of the world, and Mr. Almqvist still sings like someone who might laugh or run amok at any moment. Without their purist formula to rely on, the Hives are inconsistent. Some experiments, like the sparse piano cabaret of "Puppet on a String," work better than others, like the disco parody of "T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S." And the Hives are still best when they're rambunctious, insubordinate, speedy and guitar driven. But they sound like they're having a great time blasting out of their old niche.  JON PARELESYEASAYER"All Hour Cymbals" (We Are Free)Transformation is the subject, the method and the mission for Yeasayer on its dizzying debut album, "All Hour Cymbals." Yeasayer, a band from Brooklyn, gathers bits from traditions worldwide: the modal tunes and triplet lilt of Celtic dances, the syncopated interlock of African guitars, the drones and note-bending inflections of Indian and Balkan music. Then it immerses them in an enveloping psychedelic haze. Tablas, finger cymbals and Afro-Caribbean percussion arrive under canopies of sustained tone, and half-heard voices emerge as chorales that are part Beach Boys, part Renaissance madrigal. ("All Hour Cymbals," along with its pun on "our symbols," is an anagram of "Albums Chorally" and "Album Scholarly.") Songs end up in very different places from where they started.The lyrics contemplate cycles of family, history and nature. There are dark portents in songs like "2080," an Afro-Celtic jig that begins, "I can't sleep when I think about the times we're living in," and "Germs," which could be about a head cold or a plague. "No Need to Worry" hints at an apocalypse with "no one left to weep for us." But mourning regularly gives way to reassurance and glimmers of spirituality: "As the trees grew higher and higher and the fish began to fly/I went and stole some wings and thought why can't I," goes the album's first song, "Sunrise."The music holds echoes of Talking Heads, the Byrds, Arcade Fire, Peter Gabriel and early Pink Floyd, but Yeasayer's songs are even more molten. They dissolve and reassemble, crumble and then transfigure themselves, finding a mysterious hope in their own wildernesses.JON PARELES FREEWAY"Free at Last" (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam)In the four and a half years since he released his debut album, the Philadelphia rapper Freeway has evolved from rising star to relic. Which isn't entirely a bad thing. Back then he was one of the leading lights of Philadelphia's hardscrabble hip-hop scene, and a protégé of Beanie Sigel (and therefore Jay-Z's protégé's protégé, which counted for something). His trademarks were a bushy beard and his fervent voice, somewhere between a snarl and a yelp. And while his prospects have changed —  his label, Roc-A-Fella, has splintered; his crew, State Property, has split; his subgenre, gritty Northeastern hip-hop, has waned  —  he still sounds like his old self.Not that he hasn't noticed the changes around him. Just Blaze, who produced most of the first album, is noticeably absent throughout "Free at Last." As Freeway explains it, "I'm back, without a Just track/Tried to reach out and work, but he ain't chirp back." Happily, the tracks are still full of soul snippets and blaring horns. And though his main vocal weapon is brute force, his rhyme schemes are often unpredictable, and he loves to bring back an end rhyme just when you think he's finished with it. (One stanza goes like this: aabbcdcddddc.)He's a more convincing bully than a flirt, which explains why pop success is unlikely, and also why his lighthearted 50 Cent collaboration, "Take It to the Top," sounds a bit wan. But somehow he keeps a straight face while trading lyrics with Jay-Z in "Roc-A-Fella Billionaires." (In response Warren Buffett is  said to be  working on a song called "Berkshire Hathaway Working Stiffs.") And in "I Cry" he explains that years after his grandparents' death his Muslim faith provided both comfort and discomfort: "I finally realized that they died upon the wrong religion/Hope Allah forgive 'em." He's a former future star, reborn as a halfway bitter cult figure he always seemed to be. KELEFA SANNEH The atmosphere was electric before a recital by the pianist Denis Matsuev at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night, and the accent of the throng was mostly Russian. Mr. Matsuev, 32, won the prestigious International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1998. He has since been heralded by some critics as the successor to Russian keyboard lions like Evgeny Kissin and Arcadi Volodos, and perhaps to Vladimir Horowitz as well.In concert and on disc Mr. Matsuev has mostly specialized in finger-busting virtuoso pieces. But what was most striking about the account of Schumann's "Kinderszenen" that opened this recital was the delicacy and introversion of his playing. Starting at a hushed volume and a relaxed pace he phrased with a dreamy freedom that had the feeling of spontaneous invention.A diaphanous account of the "Träumerei" movement threatened to disappear altogether, and the bold silences and aching sustained notes of the concluding "Der Dichter Spricht" had an almost daredevil feel.Mr. Matsuev was then forced to sit patiently while latecomers were ushered to their seats, and a cellphone provided a noisy counterpoint to the hushed opening bars of Liszt's Sonata in B minor. (This and other intrusions will no doubt be magically erased when BMG Classics issues this concert on CD.)If Mr. Matsuev was frustrated, Liszt gave him ample opportunity to take it out on the keyboard. Tumultuous passages here were almost overwhelmingly raucous. But his poetic instincts held fast in tender moments, with trills as thrillingly precise as one might ever hope to hear.Liszt's "Mephisto Waltz" No. 1 is a formidable musical roller coaster, and Mr. Matsuev proved more than equal to its demonic dips and curls. He superbly captured the moody fluctuations of Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, from anxiety and brittleness to haunted rumination, and offered a primal performance of the roiling Precipato finale.Tumultuous ovations elicited five encores — Liadov's "Music Box"; a Scriabin étude (Op. 8, No. 12); "In the Hall of the Mountain King" by Grieg in a flamboyant transcription by Grigory Ginzburg; Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G minor (Op. 23, No. 5); and Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 — each greeted with increased passion. Mr. Matsuev's vitality and control in the rhapsody, which included a deliriously jazzy cadenza, offered nearly a cartoon parody of Romantic virtuosity. When it ended, one fully expected to see smoke curling from his fingertips.To the Editor:Re "The Segmented Society," by David Brooks (column, Nov. 20):Being of Mr. Brooks's generation, I agree entirely about both the fragmentation and lost intergenerational message of music today.Every new niche and genre of music falls on the ears of fewer people; within each group is an unhealthy homogenization that sets up higher barriers than already exist between us.Choice in everyday life is becoming greater each day, and music is certainly no exception.Nearly everyone loved the Stones or the Beatles. Who can say that about any one band today?The message is no longer universal but, pardon the pun, earmarked for a specific type of person.Either way, the only benefit I derive is the great variety of choices I have when searching out new material. I have found some hidden gems, just no major veins of gold. Lawrence MayerStaten Island, Nov. 20, 2007To the Editor:David Brooks is right about one thing: American music today is increasingly fragmented. But he seems to have missed the real reasons why.Modern recording technologies allow virtually anyone to record music and make it available to listeners worldwide, a privilege once enjoyed exclusively by large record companies. As a result, major record companies have increasingly less control over what gets heard, while consumers have increasingly more.It should surprise no one that in an environment of almost unlimited consumer freedom we would end up with a wider variety of preferences than those prearranged by a few record executives.As a guitar teacher, I see teenage kids today who have more artists in their iPods than I would have ever known to exist when I was their age.It's strange that Mr. Brooks, the individualist, would be bemoan the triumph of individual preferences and choices over the centralized control of a few.D. A. SiegelHoboken, N.J., Nov. 20, 2007To the Editor:I was in that audience of "The Ed Sullivan Show" on Feb. 9, 1964. Those were heady days when music and youth culture soothed the psychic wounds of war and assassinations.As a college teacher, I set aside lectures in art history to demonstrate how America created some of its greatest music — not just rock, jazz and blues but big band, twang, singing cowboys, labor songs, Broadway, Tin Pan Alley and others.There is a beautiful blend of African, English, Eastern European and Jewish culture that could happen only here. By engaging the popular arts, particularly music, back to the magic of vaudeville and even the difficult subjects of minstrel and slave songs, we honor the same roots that fed the imaginations of artists of the 1960s while reconnecting to a common history, moving beyond the mind-set that this is a merely popular culture. Tim JacksonBrookline, Mass., Nov. 20, 2007To the Editor:David Brooks tried to support the hackneyed thesis of the middle-aged "You kids and your music! It's terrible!" The current music scene is more democratic than the monolith Mr. Brooks looks back upon fondly.Is he really lamenting the end of the days when smaller musical voices were ignored and cultural power was in the hands of a select few artists and producers?The indie rock movement is not a result of purposeful fragmentation by large labels, but by individuals making music, sending it to their friends, creating a network and taking their music on the road. No current music consumers I know limit themselves to one genre of music or would depend on one artist to synthesize their cultural experience.Each generation has a cultural conversation about media, and for the music listeners of today, the element of diversity is featured prominently.Marylee MurphyMinneapolis, Nov. 20, 2007To the Editor:I am heartened by David Brooks's column about the significant contribution that Steven Van Zandt is making to the music education of our young people. Mr. Brooks accurately describes the fragmentation of our contemporary youth culture.As a community college music instructor of the next generation of musicians and music listeners, I have been acutely aware of the students' lack of knowledge about the great legacy of American musical traditions that include folk, blues, gospel, R&B and rock.At our college, we believe that teaching students about the world's diverse musical traditions results in both artistic achievement and global citizenship.In a conversation I had with Pete Seeger a few years ago, he expressed the hope that music would be a powerful healing force in an unstable world. I applaud Steven Van Zandt's efforts in helping to realize that vision.Andy  KrikunUpper Nyack, N.Y., Nov. 20, 2007The writer is an assistant professor of music at Bergen Community College.Blue neon over the stage outlines a craggy face with a sardonic smile that hovers in afterglow even after the light is switched off. The face is that of William Finn, songwriter, and it is an appropriate illustration for a revue of his work, "Make Me a Song,"  at New World Stages. Like the songs, at once slightly mocking and slightly cartoonish, it dominates the stage much as Mr. Finn's persona dominates the songs, to such an extent that even when a voluptuous blonde (Sally Wilfert) is singing, you hear the dry voice of this gay Jewish songwriter coming through her own.The mild tension between the eager, can-do spirit of a four-person show (Mr. Finn's third revue in 10 years) and the slightly acerbic content of the songs creates a diverting light entertainment. In addition to the singers — Ms. Wilfert, the smoky-voiced Sandy Binion, the hunky but strained D. B. Bonds and the Everyman Adam Heller — the show features the requisite tireless pianist, Darren R. Cohen, sometimes interjecting a line, and submitting to being spun around on his piano at the center of the stage every other song or so, a stock  device by which the director Rob Ruggiero, who conceived this show for TheaterWorks in Hartford, keeps the energy level up.The songs are taken from some of Mr. Finn's less-well-known shows ("A New Brain," "Romance in Hard Times" and a work in progress, "The Royal Family of Broadway"), as well as from his successful "Falsettos," but not, unsurprisingly, from "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee," which is still running on Broadway, at least through Jan. 20. They tend to be loose-limbed and discursive, working their way into an A section and proceeding to a resolution in a B section, with stops at several other letters along the way (as in "Hitchhiking Across America").The weakest songs are the most formulaic: "Heart and Music," about two ingredients necessary to make a song, epitomizes a certain kind of bright-eyed Broadway jingle that in Mr. Finn's voice rings slightly false.Whether funny, like "Republicans" (which is chopped up and inserted as a recurrent gag in between other songs), or sober, the songs are personal without being maudlin, with the possible exception of "Anytime," a deliberate tear-jerker for and about a deceased friend. The best example is "Passover," a reminiscence of a childhood holiday that grows poignant without wallowing in sentiment, simply acknowledging family members who have died, and getting on with it.Sigur RosThe music of this Icelandic band has always managed to suggest both the comfort of the womb and the majesty of open sky. In "Heima" (XL), a new film by Nick Fenton and Dean DeBlois, that unlikely combination gets some vivid context: a series of free, mostly unadvertised concerts held in Iceland over the summer of 2006 at sites including a windswept hillside and a dilapidated herring factory. Mr. DeBlois photographs these spaces, however epic or claustrophobic, in sumptuous detail; "Heima," which means "homeland" as well as "home," can feel like a travelogue in the guise of a concert film. As the band commingles with fellow countrymen (and women, and a lot of fair-haired children), its homecoming project comes to feel noble as well as quixotic. And all the musicians — especially Jon Thor  Birgisson, a vocalist who leaves no distance between the angelic and the alien — seem closely attuned to their surroundings. So while Sigur Ros has also just issued "Hvarf/Heim" (XL), an enchanting double EP of mostly acoustic performances, the film provides a better sense of the band's ethereal magic. It does so through counterintuitive means: by conveying a concrete sense of place.NirvanaBy contrast "Unplugged in New York" (Geffen/MTV Networks/UMe), the first official DVD release of a broadcast taped 14 years ago, constrains its action to the Sony Music Studios. Kurt Cobain and his band mates, playing the smoldering show that would yield an ageless album, appear on a stage festooned with candelabras and Stargazer lilies. (The funereal mood was Mr. Cobain's idea, the producer Alex Coletti suggests in a behind-the-scenes feature, "but it certainly took on a completely different meaning after Kurt died.") Since most of this material is deeply familiar, "Unplugged in New York" earns points mainly for its lack of interference. The hourlong concert feels much more immediate in unedited form. Mr. Cobain swivels in his office chair, trades quips with the bassist Krist Novoselic, gamely banters with the audience. His solo version of "Pennyroyal Tea" is now unequivocally explained by rehearsal footage, which reveals just how bad it sounded otherwise. And there's something endearing about the moment he chooses to play two similar tunes in tandem, after a bit of hesitation. "Let's just play them back to back, who cares?" he says. "It'll be edited different. This is a television show."AyoCosmopolitanism is a birthright for this singer-songwriter, whose German passport bears the name Joy Olasunmibo Ogunmakin. Her father, a Nigerian who was a part-time D.J., was the first to call her Ayo, the Yoruban word for joy; her mother, a Romanian Gypsy, threw the family into turmoil after acquiring a heroin addiction. All this history — and presumably the influence of her husband, the German reggae artist Patrice Bart-Williams — informs "Joyful," an album that has already topped some charts in Europe. (Interscope is releasing it stateside this week.) Over the course of a dozen songs, all originals except Abbey Lincoln's "And It's Supposed to Be Love," Ayo dwells on themes of personal struggle, perseverance and hope. Her voice is airily soulful — Sade inevitably crops up in comparison — and she works against an acoustic backdrop that feels both effortless and focused. (The producer, Jay Newland, has worked with Norah Jones and many others, including Ms. Lincoln.) Of course the looming question is whether Ayo can resonate with an American audience. She'll have a direct opportunity in New York on Tuesday, opening for Sly and the Family Stone at the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill in Midtown, and all along the East Coast next month, opening for Babyface (www.ayomusic.com).Michael BlakeThe tenor and soprano saxophonist Michael Blake has produced an impressive body of work over the past decade, with each new release confirming his acutely omnivorous tastes. "Slow Poke at Home" is the ad hoc album he made in 1998 with the slide guitarist David Tronzo, the drummer Kenny Wollesen and the bassist Tony Scherr (who recorded the music at his house). Now available through palmetto-records.net, it features bone-dry renditions of Eddie Harris and Neil Young tunes, as well as three pieces by Mr. Blake. What it doesn't include is the panoramic imagination of "Amor de Cosmos" (Songlines), Mr. Blake's engrossing new studio release. Here the compositions assume a slippery depth, and the ensemble — a sextet of resourceful Canadians, including the trumpeter Brad Turner and the drummer Dylan van der Schyff — treads nimbly and boldly. Mr. Blake, on tenor especially, is an endlessly engaging improviser, and an inquisitive one. The album may be named after an eccentric who was British Columbia's second premier (something of a long story), but its innovations feel personal and close at hand.Ambrose AkinmusireA few weeks ago the 25-year-old trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire (ah-KIN-moo-SEE-ray) won the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in Los Angeles. Actually it might be more illustrative to say he demolished the competition: Mr. Akinmusire, born in Nigeria and raised in Oakland, Calif., played with such insight and confidence that the outcome felt like a lock as soon as he left the stage. For the time being, he has no solo albums. But there are tantalizing audio clips at ambroseakinmusire.com, and he can be heard on albums like "Casually Introducing Walter Smith III" (Fresh Sound New Talent), the 2006 debut of his close colleague, a tenor saxophonist, and "The Antisocial Club" (Cryptogramophone), a new fusion release by the keyboardist Alan Pasqua. Of course the greater vehicle for Mr. Akinmusire will be a concert on Dec. 10 at the TriBeCa  Performing Arts Center (tribecapac.org). There he'll take on more self-determined challenges, surrounded by sidemen of his choosing.
