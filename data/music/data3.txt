The final concert of the season at the 92nd Street Y's chamber music series, on Wednesday evening, was devoted to works for strings and included a duo, a trio, a quintet and a sextet. But instrumental combinations aside, the most striking aspect of the program was the way warm-toned, comfortably familiar music was juxtaposed with early-20th-century works that had sharper and more ragged edges.At the start and finish, there was Schubert — the incomplete, single-movement String Trio in B flat (D. 471) as a curtain-raiser, and the magnificent "Two Cellos" Quintet (D. 956) as the finale.There is no denying the intoxicating beauty of this music or the richness of the performances. In the chordal writing at the start of the Trio, Jaime Laredo, the violinist; Ida Kavafian, the violist; and Sharon Robinson, the cellist, produced a finely balanced, perfectly weighted sound. As the chords melted into counterpoint, the ensemble played with a brightness and lilt that evoked the Vienna of the 19-year-old Schubert, who completed the first movement and a few dozen bars of a second (these were not performed) before abandoning it.Fleeting moments of stridency and slack ensemble took a small toll on the C major Quintet, for which Mr. Laredo, Ms. Kavafian and Ms. Robinson were joined by the violinist Daniel Hope and the cellist Paul Watkins. Even so, the winning fluidity in the group's rendering of the big, seductive themes, and the players' attention to Schubert's nuanced dynamics, proved the reading's more memorable qualities.But for all that, the program's real heart was lesser-known works by Gideon Klein and Erwin Schulhoff, two Czech composers killed by the Nazis, who found both their Jewishness and their modernism objectionable. Klein was represented by an unfinished Duo for Violin and Cello, composed in 1941, the year he was sent to the Terezin concentration camp. Mr. Hope and Mr. Watkins gave a vigorous performance of its dark, brash, occasionally jazz-tinged opening movement, and played as much of the introspective Lento as Klein completed, stopping abruptly in midphrase.The real find here was Schulhoff's Sextet, an assertive, rich-textured work completed in 1924 and steeped in influences that range from the harmonic density of Janacek and pre-12-tone Schoenberg to the rhythmic densities of jazz. An eerily repetitive descending figure, of the sort that would commonly evoke danger in film scores two decades later, is the fuel of the second movement; the third movement is propelled by a hint of Dvorakian folksiness, couched in updated harmonies.The ensemble — Mr. Laredo, Ms. Kavafian, Ms. Robinson, Mr. Watkins, the violist Mark Holloway and the violinist Bella Hristova — played the score with both polish and passion.Music and DanceBAY SHORE Boulton Center for the Performing Arts Dar Williams, singer-songwriter.

Luciani, author of "Self-Coaching." "Consider any common themes on your list in making future decisions."PERFECT JOBS Given the focus of the magazine — it is, after all, called Outside — most of the attention is paid to employment that requires a bit of strenuous exercise. That said, the magazine's cover article — "37 Dream Jobs" —does list some pretty cool occupations.There are the people who are paid to surf —  they are either on the professional surfing tour (yep, there is one), design surf gear and accessories, or both. There are charter boat captains, heli-ski pilots ("a recent pilot shortage has made being a chop jock more lucrative") and "enviro-crusaders" like James Gustave Speth, dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and others.And then there is the common fantasy of becoming a winemaker. Ames Morison, who used to teach school in the South Bronx, bought (with the help of a friend, Christopher Medlock James, "a money manager") a 320-acre property in Sonoma County, California, in 1998.Three years later, they bottled their first merlot. They have subsequently added a cabernet sauvignon and a chardonnay to the Medlock Ames label.POSITIVE SPIN It probably won't surprise you to learn that Google, which is famous for catering to its workers, offers employees on-site bicycle-repair kits, loaner bikes and bike racks on company shuttle vans (with the promise of an emergency lift home, should you need it.)But what is unexpected, according to Bicycling Magazine, is how many other companies are offering incentives to pedal to work. For example, the Calvert Group, which sells mutual funds, offers a "one-time $350 reimbursement toward purchase of a bicycle for commuting."Stark Mountain Woodworking in Vermont goes further, offering $500 to buy a bike and another $500 "for logging 650 annual bike-commuting miles.""If your workplace doesn't offer similar benefits, slip this list onto the boss's desk — or use it to plan your next career move," the author, Alan Coté, suggests.If he gets cranky, we guess you can always pedal to the unemployment line.THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS If you want to be more creative, have more fun. That is the conclusion Prevention draws from a University of Toronto study that showed that "volunteers were better able to solve challenging word puzzles after thinking happy thoughts and listening to upbeat music."Conversely, Amanda MacMillan writes, serious moods and sad music "limited their ability to think outside the box.""If you're upset," she writes, "your brain focuses only on what you're anxious about — like peering through a narrow porthole."PERSUASIVE COFFEE "Having trouble convincing a colleague that you're right? Slip her a couple of iced cappuccinos," Working Mother writes. A moderate dose of caffeine (about two cups of coffee) might make her see your side, according to research published in The European Journal of Social Psychology.The study found that in addition to increasing alertness, caffeine increases the ability to be influenced."It's most effective in the morning, so for the sake of argument, deliver that java early."FINAL TAKE The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to Entrepreneur magazine, reports that 15.4 percent — that is more than one in seven — sexual harassment cases last year were filed by men.PAUL B. BROWNLISTENERS who regularly make their way along the main roads and side streets of New York music know that it won't be long before they come across another young pianist from the former Soviet Union. One hardly needs to open the program. Correct Mozart or Beethoven will be offered as a duty fulfilled. There will be high-powered Chopin or Liszt played with staggering competence.The real business of the day will be Rachmaninoff or Prokofiev done with grand gestures, Big Bertha-like fortissimos and a command of right notes guaranteed to stun even the most distracted audience. These young people have either embryonic careers or no careers at all and play mostly in small spaces whose acoustical limitations they ignore. The music will be thick, ferocious and committed to the big boom, because so much of the modern Russian repertory that they are specifically trained to play asks them to perform this way. Brutality is met with brutality in perfect symbiosis. How extraordinary these pianists are, and how they depress me.In the Soviet era piano classes were in part international competition factories manufacturing faster, louder musicians capable of crushing opposition and waving the Red flag above cultural as well as political ground. Few students have had the personality to separate themselves from this gray army of virtuosos. Ivo Pogorelich (Serbian but trained in Moscow from an early age) was one, but he chose a path toward weirdness and self-indulgence from which the steps seem irretraceable.Evgeny Kissin, probably the biggest talent of his generation, is another. Put the right Liszt or Chopin piece in front of him, and the results are breathtaking. When Mr. Kissin moved to the West, a wider world awaited him: Alfred Brendel playing Haydn; Mitsuko Uchida, Mozart; the French, Fauré; and the Viennese, Brahms. There were lessons from the early-music specialists to absorb and great orchestras to hear. None of the above has had much effect. Mr. Kissin playing Schubert has its own weirdness, revealing a near-genius who understands Classical style at the level of the 11-year-old prodigy he once was.Hovering over all of this is Sviatoslav Richter, who died 10 years ago at 82. Decca has produced three two-CD reissues of his recordings: one all Mozart, another all Beethoven and the third a collection of 20th-century Russians. They are in a different category. Richter did and did not belong to the era in which he lived. No teacher ruined him because he largely taught himself and did not pursue organized piano studies until his 20s.Turn first to the Mozart, all live recordings, to hear how good he was. Not much happens in the slow movement of the early Sonata in F (K. 280), and Richter makes doing almost nothing into an act of supreme musical mastery. Keeping the tempo in the first movement of the B flat Sonata (K. 333) becomes not an act of pedantry but a manifestation of good health. The finale is so relaxed that it is hard at first to notice that an extraordinary physical talent allows it to be so.Richter understood scale in a way those young Moscow-trained pianists do not. He brings appropriately crushing weight to Prokofiev piano sonatas (the Fourth and the Sixth here), but the excerpts from the "Visions Fugitives" are small and bright. Mozart inhabits a similarly cut-back sound world. The four Scriabin pieces melt with beauty, but it is Richter's control that lets us hear every flutter and sigh independently of every other.In Beethoven he is again best at small things, namely the two Opus 49 Sonatas, here made gentle and low-key. Richter even resurrects the black sheep of the Beethoven sonatas, Opus 54, though it may have been forgotten for good reason. He is least satisfactory in the late sonatas (Opp. 109 and 110), which sound less like gifts of music than like admonitions. Slow tempos are chosen almost willfully and then grimly clung to. We receive lessons in sobriety from a humorless teacher. The "Appassionata" Sonata is similarly stubborn, as if Richter were trying to wipe away a long history of flamboyance and pyrotechnics associated with the piece. Perhaps he did not consider the possibility that Beethoven liked all that glitter and virtuosity.Richter's menacing public image had as much to with the cold war as with anything else. The Soviets kept him at home, but recordings leaked out. People like Van Cliburn and Glenn Gould came back from Moscow with positive reports. There was the dour presence: the big, jutting, unsmiling face; the thin, cold features. Richter was suffused with the romance of inaccessibility. He made no secret of not liking the United States, which made Americans clamor for him even more. He finally arrived in 1960 and left speaking well of American museums, orchestras, cocktails and films, though not much else.But America, as it often does, did wonders for his world reputation, and in later years Richter seems to have been able to do as he pleased, avoiding the big-city touring circuit and embracing small festivals and spur-of-the moment recitals in obscure places. Like most unusual talents, Richter was ambiguous, professing asceticism and reclusiveness but relentlessly in the public eye. In my experience he was the most photographed and filmed classical performer after Toscanini, with only Herbert von Karajan as competition. There is a theater to all public personas, and Richter played himself well.Sometimes it seems as if brand-name performers feel there is no need to put in unnecessary blood, sweat and tears when they are practically guaranteed an ovation (and enormous fees) for just showing up.But musicians don't become household names for nothing. During the violinist Itzhak Perlman's recital on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall there were the flashes of the sweet, alluring tone, with its wide vibrato, that propelled him to fame in the first place.But there were also occasional intonation problems and blurry passages that would have been irrelevant if the overall performance had been more passionate. A few minor slips should not detract too much from a listener's enjoyment if the performer's heart is in the music.Granted, Schubert's "Rondo Brillant" for Violin and Piano in B minor and Strauss's Sonata for Violin and Piano in E flat major, which made up the first half of the program, are not pieces of music to stir or challenge the soul. But it was disappointing that Mr. Perlman, in an ineffective collaboration with the pianist Rohan De Silva, who accompanied him, seemed to be merely going through the motions. It was perhaps telling that two audience members in orchestra seats didn't bother to look up from the books they were reading until the encores.The many encores came after Lukas Foss's melodious "Three American Pieces" (1944), which opened the second half of the program. The works are from what Mr. Foss, whose music encompasses a wide range of compositional styles, calls his American period, written in his early 20s after he emigrated to the United States at 15. Mr. Perlman (who has recorded these works) sounded marginally more convincing.The encores included Schumann's Fantasiestücke (Op. 73), transcriptions by Kreisler and Heifetz, including the latter's version of Gershwin's "It Ain't Necessarily So," Bazzini's "Dance of the Goblins" and Elgar's "Salut d'Amour."Mr. Perlman spoke to the audience between the encores with engaging charm and an appealing sense of humor. It was a shame that his winning personality didn't translate into his playing, but the crowd gave him an ovation nonetheless.AT 6-foot-7 and shod in size 16 two-tone cowboy boots, it's hard to picture anything halfway about Ray Benson, the guitarist and leader of the western swing band Asleep at the Wheel. But Mr. Benson admits that for all his success as a musician — nine Grammys' worth — he wasn't the all-around businessman he aimed to be."I have half the attributes," he said. "I need a detail person. I'm a big picture person." That may make the business-side overhaul Mr. Benson has accomplished even more impressive than his collection of awards. Mr. Benson had to overcome his business shortcomings to catapult his band into an unlikely growth phase 37 years after it was formed. The band has found a new audience, won new critical acclaim and reinvigorated its music sales, while profiting as never before.Mr. Benson credits the band's business manager, Peter Schwarz. Together, they are a  seeming study in opposites: Mr. Schwarz is a 5-foot-7 Harvard M.B.A. — albeit one who spent a decade playing bass in a Cajun band.Since striking a partnership in 2001, the Wheel, as its fans refer to it, has returned to its core mission as an ensemble band, embraced its niche appeal and, in a risky move, adapted its stage show into a theatrical play. "We are still pinching ourselves that we are in a growth stage," Mr. Schwarz said.The Wheel is hardly the only legacy act on tour. "I think there are a lot of bands that have viable careers that have been doing it as long" as the Wheel, said Owen Sloane, an entertainment lawyer in Marina Del Ray, Calif. "Especially with the Indian casinos opening." He added that performers like Poison, Kenny Rogers and Ozzy Osborne still have working careers, even if they do not sell many records.The Wheel's first success came in 1975, when its country song, "The Letter That Johnny Walker Read," reached the Top 10. The band regularly opened for performers like Tammy Wynette and Donna Fargo."We were opening big shows in big places," Mr. Benson said. "Famous people came to see us. Rolling Stone wrote about us. We thought that the gravy train would never end."While he didn't spend wads of cash on cars and houses, he did spend freely on the band. It grew to 12 pieces, but that did not fatten revenue. "I grossed $1 million and was in debt," Mr. Benson said. "Something wasn't right."Matters got worse in the '80s, when the band was long off the charts and paychecks shrank. "This was the low point in our career," he said. "Disco was happening. We were not." A 1986 comeback hit, "The House of Blue Lights," and a television movie with Dolly Parton put Mr. Benson in the black and the band in the public eye again. The momentum continued with a 1998 Grammy.During this time, Mr. Benson became more careful in his spending and, recognizing a sideline he had found in voiceover work, started more businesses.Against all advice, he built a studio in Austin, Tex. Using his networking talent, he traded endorsements for discounts on studio equipment. He also used his Rolodex to draw acts like Willie Nelson and Manhattan Transfer to record there."Ray knows everybody," said Terry Lickona, chairman of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which awards the Grammys. "It amazes me how many people consider Ray not just someone they know but a good friend."Although he had warned Mr. Benson that the studio was a losing proposition, Mr. Lickona said, "In retrospect, it was a pretty smart business decision."Mr. Benson, who still hadn't completely mastered finance, commingled his personal income with that of the band, which became problematic in a 2001  divorce from his wife, who was also his business manager.That became the Wheel's major turning point. A search for a new manager led to Mr. Schwarz, son of Tracy Schwarz, a member of the influential Americana band the New Lost City Ramblers. The younger Mr. Schwarz became a musician and road manager with Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys. But when his wife was earning an M.B.A., he found, "it shocked me that a traditional business education would address issues important to me in running a band." He left the Playboys and went to Harvard for a business degree of his own.Now Mr. Schwarz's responsibility is to apply "straight M.B.A. stuff" to Mr. Benson's creativity. "My job is to guide him in what ideas are going to stick," Mr. Schwarz said. "How big is the audience? Is there money in it? In the music business, there really isn't that rigor."The reasons this partnership works are complex. Partly, it's the age spread between Mr. Benson, who is 56, and Mr. Schwarz, 39."I view Ray as a mentor," Mr. Schwarz said. Mr. Benson said, "Peter is very conservative financially, which is his job, because I'm not."Owning a studio has cut production costs and allowed the Wheel to create specialty projects, Mr. Benson said. The goal was to beat the classic record industry system, in which the label pays for a band's recording, promotion and distribution, then deducts the expenses from the band's royalties until it is repaid, which in Mr. Benson's case was almost never. Worse, the record company owned all rights to the music.With his own studio, the goal was to create CDs that the band would own and that could turn a profit with far fewer sales."There are 100,000 to 150,000 people who are passionate fans that spend $20 to $100 a year on the Wheel," Mr. Schwarz said. "The Internet allows us to capture that."Mr. Benson also saw an opportunity in new distribution channels. In 2003, the Cracker Barrel store chain underwrote and distributed a Wheel CD, "Hang Up My Spurs." He also used the strategy with the H-E-B grocery chain to sell a Christmas album, "Santa Loves to Boogie," and a new release, "Reinventing the Wheel."The band's  recent innovation grew out of Mr. Benson's wish to mark the 100th birthday of the western swing pioneer Bob Wills."I got this idea to do a play and honor this guy whose horse we rode for 30 years," he said. Mr. Benson was supposed to meet Mr. Wills in the '70s, but Mr. Wills suffered a stroke, and the meeting never happened. The play, "A Ride With Bob," imagines Mr. Benson meeting Mr. Wills's ghost, with his life acted out in vignettes and song.Mr. Benson persuaded sponsors to underwrite the cost of mounting the play, raising more than $700,000 in grants from H-E-B, Buick, oil companies and others. All ticket sales go to the band.Beyond that, the play had another advantage. "We were reaching a completely new audience," Mr. Benson said — theatergoers who might never set foot in a beer joint, or even in a cowboy boot.
