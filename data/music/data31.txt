NASHVILLETWO years ago, the book "Lost Delta Found" criticized the American folklorist Alan Lomax for giving short shrift to the work of three black researchers with whom he made some of his landmark field recordings in the 1940s. Maybe more important, the book argued that our appreciation of the black roots music of the era would have been greatly enriched had the writings of the researchers reached a wider audience. With the release of "Recording Black Culture," an album consisting largely of newly unearthed acetates made by one of the collectors, John Work III, we now have the music itself to buttress this claim.Mr. Work, the most eminent of the black folklorists, was not merely an acolyte of Mr. Lomax but clearly had ideas of his own. Where Mr. Lomax tended to treat black vernacular music as an artifact in need of preservation, Mr. Work sought to document it as it was unfolding. Thus on "Recording Black Culture," instead of spirituals harking back to the 19th century, we hear febrile gospel shouting set to the cadences of what soon would become rhythm and blues and rock 'n' roll.Robert Gordon, who edited "Lost Delta Found" with Bruce Nemerov, cites the hot, driving piano on Mr. Work's recording of a group of Primitive Baptist women singing a song called "I Am His, He Is Mine" as an example."There's nascent boogie-woogie in that music," said Mr. Gordon, who has also written a biography of the blues singer Muddy Waters, whom Mr. Work and Mr. Lomax recorded on their trip to Coahoma County, Miss., in 1941. "That piano would have made many loyal churchgoers angry: a harbinger of the response to R&B and rock 'n' roll."The pressing harmonic and rhythmic interplay of the Heavenly Gate Quartet singing "If I Had My Way"  offers further evidence of this evolution. The heavy syncopation heard there and in Mr. Work's recording of the Fairfield Four's "Walk Around in Dry Bones" presage doo-wop a good decade before vocal groups like the Clovers and the Coasters would establish it as the soundtrack for young black America in the 1950s.This isn't to claim Dead Sea Scrolls-like significance for the music on the new CD. Black Americans, though, were making the transition from rural to urban life. Spirituals were being supplanted by music that was more agreeable to black communities in which congregations were buying pianos so they could play the songs of contemporary gospel composers like the Rev. Thomas A. Dorsey during worship. Mr. Work was committed to capturing these changes as they were happening rather than after the fact.Issued by Spring Fed Records, a label based in Woodbury, Tenn., "Recording Black Culture" demonstrates not only Mr. Work's understanding of the dynamic way vernacular music functioned in black culture but also his omnivorous musical appetite. In addition to dramatic examples of gospel singers anticipating rock 'n' roll, the selections include rare recordings ranging from black Sacred Harp singing to the virtuoso banjo playing of Nathan Frazier, performing as half of the banjo-and-fiddle duo Frazier & Patterson.Classically trained at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (now a part of Juilliard), Mr. Work became a professor of music at Fisk University in Nashville; from 1947 to 1966 he was the director of the school's spirituals chorus, the Jubilee Singers. His son John Work IV recalled that his father, who died in 1967, was also conversant with jazz."I remember Duke Ellington coming to the house on at least three occasions," John Work IV wrote in an e-mail message from New York City. "On one of these, I am sure that I was a slight embarrassment to my father when Maestro Ellington went to the piano and played 'Sophisticated Lady' and one other major composition and I could recognize neither."Mr. Work's expansive grasp of black music was reflected in his approach to collecting source material. "Instead of pigeonholing musicians in terms of what he wanted them to play, Work acted as a fly on the wall and recorded what was there at the moment," said Evan Hatch, the producer with Mr. Nemerov of "Recording Black Culture." "He accepted what was indicative of the culture, as opposed to only going after what he expected or thought should be there."Mr. Work's method of documenting the music proved a corrective to the sometimes romantic approach of Mr. Lomax, who viewed the spiritual, for example, as the apex of black culture and largely ignored the new sounds emerging from Southern black churches. "Blues had become established," Mr. Gordon said, "and churchgoers began to ask, 'Why should the devil get all the good tunes?'"Mr. Lomax also seemed preoccupied with old work songs at a time when the cotton fields were becoming mechanized. "Workers weren't just dragging the big sacks behind them in the fields anymore," Mr. Nemerov explained. "Muddy Waters was a tractor driver."But to be fair to the Lomaxes," he added, referring both to Mr. Lomax and to his father, the pioneering folklorist John Lomax, "they were interested in preserving music that wasn't going to be around in 10 years' time. You can't fault them for that, but not knowing all the details, modern listeners get a skewed view of what black people liked to sing. Thus you have people listening to this music 20 or 30 years later going, 'Oh, look, black people love to sing 'Go Down,  Moses,' when that wasn't really the case."Racial dynamics at the time might have contributed to the Lomaxes' view of the music. Because of the prevalence of lynchings and Jim Crow laws, many Southern blacks might have been wary of white folklorists from the Northeast. As a black man and a Southerner, Mr. Work would have had a much easier time gaining entree to churches, dances and other social events than would his white counterparts."Work clearly would have had a rapport with the church singers, especially with the church hierarchy, being from a religiously based college like Fisk," said David Evans, the director of the doctoral program in ethnomusicology at the University of Memphis. "There was also the reputation of the Jubilee Singers. All of that would have given him a kind of in."Unable in some cases to gain such access, the Lomaxes turned to the prisons, where inmates like Lead Belly had no choice but to sing at the warden's bidding. "Lead Belly of course is an icon of American music, so it's not to be dismissed," said Mr. Nemerov. "Nevertheless, the Lomaxes gave America a very peculiar view of black music. Professor Work's recordings give us a much more balanced view, both in terms of music and social class, of the black culture of the time."Why Mr. Work did not publicize the acetates that have been meticulously remastered on "Recording Black Culture" remains unclear. When Mr. Nemerov found the discs in the attic of the Work home near the Fisk campus a few years ago, they appeared to have been played frequently, suggesting that they were dear to Mr. Work.Some of the recordings that he had made with Mr. Lomax, largely the work songs and spirituals favored by Mr. Lomax, had been deposited in the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. The rest of the performances, which have gone unheard by the public for the better part of seven decades, give a more expansive view of the black vernacular music of the time."Professor Work had big ears," Mr. Nemerov said. "The overarching theme here is just how much music there was in the black community before World War II. It just seemed to be everywhere, and in every layer of black culture, not just in the cotton fields and prisons."How should a musician celebrate Christmas? Plunge into the holiday bustle or reconnect to tradition; savor the comfort of familiarity or seek a new personal twist; pay attention to family, to faith or, perhaps, to food. All those choices are part of this year's notable holiday albums, reviewed here by the music critics of The New York Times.YOLANDA ADAMS: 'WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME' (Columbia). Yolanda Adams has made pop-gospel her career, so it's surprising that her Christmas album often leans toward the holiday's secular side. Her clear, supple voice is at home in R&B or jazz, and she thrives in upbeat songs backed by a big band, including the album's title song and a version of "Jingle Bells" with horns that hint at Steely Dan. Her "Little Drummer Boy" is a fantasia with her voice leaping above power chords, Latin syncopations, gospel and jazz piano. She ends with a message of faith, but the album also shows her playful side. JON PARELES THE ISLEY BROTHERS FEATURING RONALD ISLEY: 'I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS' (Def Soul/Island Def Jam). A new Isley Brothers song demands only two things: a slow or medium funk tempo and Ronald Isley's gorgeous voice, spinning endless falsetto variations on one of Sam Cooke's old vocal signatures. Occasionally it still needs Ronald's brother Ernie on guitar leads. Here, on their first Christmas album, it has Ronald on every track; Ernie forsook the traditional Christmas songs ("Winter Wonderland," "I'll Be Home for Christmas") and appears only on the album's one new Isleys-qua-Isleys song, the typically luscious, moody stalemate-of-the-sexes "What Can I Buy You?" ("I'll buy you anything you want, but you don't care/I never felt this broke being a millionaire.") BEN RATLIFF JARS OF CLAY: 'CHRISTMAS SONG' (Gray Matters/Nettwerk). For a Christian rock act a Christmas album isn't merely a novelty or a cash-in; it's a chance to bring together old sacred songs with new (and sometimes secular) ones. So it goes on "Christmas Song," from Jars of Clay, the long-running alternative rock band from Tennessee. (You may remember the group's only Top 40 hit, "Flood," from 1995.) The most ambitious of this CD's new songs is "Peace Is Here," a war-is-over reverie that never quite gels. The warm, synthesizer-enhanced covers are better: There is a sleek version of Paul McCartney's "Wonderful Christmastime," and "O Little Town of Bethlehem" gets a warm-and-buzzy makeover. Fans who want a more theological experience can seek out "Peace Is Here: Christmas Reflections," the companion hardcover book. KELEFA SANNEH TOBY KEITH: 'CLASSIC CHRISTMAS' (Show Dog). The gas-guzzler of new Christmas albums, this is a two-disc package of traditional Christmas songs packaged in two separate plastic cases, with a slipcase too. There's nothing as special here as the original songs on Mr. Keith's first holiday record, "Christmas to Christmas"; with his confident baritone this supersized album links tradition ("O Come All Ye Faithful") to kitsch ("Frosty the Snowman") as easily and drowsily as falling off a Yule log. BEN RATLIFFPATTI LABELLE: 'MISS PATTI'S CHRISTMAS' (Def Soul/Island Def Jam). Patti LaBelle may be a little strident, but ultimately she wants you to be yourself. So for the string of slow jams on the first half of this record you are allowed to sit by the fire and stew in your own juices, with very little sense of occasion. (From "Holidays Mean More to Me": "No way, no pressure — yes I know it's Christmas Eve, and we don't even have a tree/No rush to give me a present, your presence is enough for me/Stay at home, I'll be happy.") Then something fortunate happens: Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the producers, perk up the album with up-tempo gospel funk ("Nativity") and old-time gospel, with the vocal group the Soul Seekers. BEN RATLIFF VICTOR MANUELLE: 'UNA NAVIDAD A MI ESTILO' (Machete Music). A salsa superstar, Victor Manuelle celebrates "A Christmas in My Style" with brisk Puerto Rican rhythms and crisp tracks that interlace percussion, horns and rural touches like the plucky counterpoint of accordion or the Puerto Rican íbaro (hillbilly) guitar, the cuatro. The songs reminisce about family, neighborhood, the festive serenades called parrandas and, in more than one song, the traditional feast of lechón, roast suckling pig. With propulsion like this, the songs should make it easy to dance off the calories. JON PARELES'PEANUT BUTTER WOLF PRESENTS BADD SANTA: A STONES THROW RECORDS XMAS' (Stones Throw; available in the United States exclusively at Urban Outfitters). An appropriately absurd compilation from Stones Throw, the label known for idiosyncratic hip-hop. James Brown ("Go Power at Christmas Time") shares space with the electronic-music pioneer Bruce Haack, whose "I Like Christmas" sounds positively psychotic. Also included: obscure old hip-hop (remember the Busy Boys?), a spaced-out Kwanzaa song and — best of all, perhaps — a delirious appearance from Quad City DJ's, the group best known for the club smash "C'mon Ride It (The Train)." For a certain kind of listener (by now you should know who you are) this CD might be the perfect antidote to the others on this page. KELEFA SANNEHMINDY SMITH: 'MY HOLIDAY' (Vanguard). This might be the year's prettiest Christmas album, and it might be the best: a casual but thoughtful collection from a great singer-songwriter who knows how to evoke the feeling of warm rooms on cold nights. Ms. Smith adds hints of twang and swing to chestnuts like "The Christmas Song" and "I'll Be Home for Christmas." Even better are the new songs she wrote, alone or with help. "Santa Will Find You" revolves around a wistful promise ("Santa will find you, wherever you are"), and the title track gently reprimands the Yuletide scolds, offering a muted defense of fake trees and lavish gift giving. At the very end there's "Come Around," a jangly, upbeat rock song that unites celebration and salvation. "Jesus has come to save us all from sin," she sings, and it really does sound like good news. KELEFA SANNEHTHE STAPLE SINGERS: 'THE 25TH DAY OF DECEMBER' (Riverside/Concord). There's a down-home charm to this reissue of an unvarnished 1962 session by the quartet of Roebuck (Pops) Staples and his children Mavis, Yvonne and Pervis. Sounding relaxed and barely rehearsed, they harmonize backed by Pops Staples's bluesy guitar, along with a drummer and an organist who seems to be just learning the chords. Pops and Mavis split the lead vocals; Pops is knowing and ghostly, and Mavis is well on the way to the sultry fervor she would reveal fully in the late 1960s, especially in "There Was a Star," with its rolling 1950s-R&B vamp. JON PARELES'THIS CHRISTMAS: SONGS FROM THE MOTION PICTURE' (Jive/Zomba). This soundtrack is a major-label R&B grab bag. There are a handful of new recordings: Jordin Sparks sings a smooth "Silent Night"; Chris Brown tackles "This Christmas" as well as "Try a Little Tenderness"; Anthony Hamilton joins Boney James for "Silent Night." And alongside classic recordings from Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye, there is holiday music of more recent vintage. TLC's "Sleigh Ride" is a pleasant surprise, though not quite pleasant enough to make up for the boy band B2K doing battle with "Jingle Bells."

Mozart's "Impresario" (libretto by Gottlieb Stephanie) is about a manager's battles with a feisty troupe of performers. Richard Wargo's "Music Shop" (based on a short story by Chekhov) follows a husband who, assisted by a music shop owner and his assistant, tries to remember the name of a song his domineering wife asked him to purchase. Both will be performed by Dicapo's  young resident artists, conducted by Samuel Bill. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $35. (Vivien Schweitzer)★ 'IPHIGÉNIE EN TAURIDE' (Saturday and Tuesday) After a 90-year absence, Gluck's crowning achievement comes to the Met in a grimly effective production by Stephen Wadsworth. The mezzo-soprano Susan Graham portrays the haunted daughter of King Agamemnon affectingly — an intense, vulnerable and vocally lustrous performance. The Met is using a later version of the opera with the lead baritone role of Oreste adapted for tenor voice. The reason is to accommodate Plácido Domingo, singing his 125th role and still taking artistic chances. Though he has to conserve his power, he throws himself, sometimes bodily, into the role and sings with astonishing vigor. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)'NORMA' (Friday) In the preseason shuffling of singers that took place at the Metropolitan Opera this summer, Maria Guleghina was substituted out of the first performances of "Norma," and given Lady Macbeth. She has, however, stepped in to cover the later performances in the run. Ms. Guleghina always gives her all, sometimes erratically, sometimes wildly, but with conviction. Most of the rest of the cast is unchanged: Dolora Zajick is an old-school presence who sings most impressively; Franco Farina is his usual solid but unspectacular self as Pollione. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette)OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK (Thursday) The music director Eve Queler opens this group's 37th season with Verdi's rarely performed "I Due Foscari," a struggle of family loyalties and political turmoil based on Lord Byron's play "The Two Foscari." The cast includes the soprano Julianna Di Giacomo, with Aquiles Machado, Luke Grooms, Paolo Gavanelli and Ricardo Lugo. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $125. (Schweitzer)'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Saturday and Wednesday) You can be forgiven for losing count of the Roméos that move through the Met's production of this Gounod classic this season. If you go to both performances this week, you can catch two very different singers in that lead role: Joseph Kaiser sings it Saturday, and Roberto Alagna picks it up on Wednesday. You get your choice of Mercutio as well: Jeff Mattsey Saturday, and Nathan Gunn on Wednesday. Otherwise, Anna Nebrebko continues to make an enchanting Juliette, and Plácido Domingo is still conducting. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Allan Kozinn)★ 'WAR AND PEACE' (Monday and Thursday) The Met's first production of Prokofiev's daunting operatic version of Tolstoy's novel was a landmark for the house in 2002. The sheer number of performers involved was staggering: 52 singers portraying 68 characters; 118 choristers; 41 dancers; and 227 supernumeraries. Valery Gergiev, who spearheaded the project, conducted a stirring performance, and the cast was excellent. The achievement was undermined, though, by the production, particularly the set, dominated by a rotating, domelike and dangerous-looking platform. Met officials report that the height of the dome has been scaled down for the revival of the production, which opens on Monday, with Mr. Gergiev again conducting. The opera is arguably Prokofiev's masterpiece. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $320 tickets remaining for Monday; $65 to $175 for Thursday. (Tommasini)★ 'WHAT NEXT?' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday) Elliott Carter wrote this opera, his first, when he was 90, and given the rate at which he continues to work as he approaches his 99th birthday — on the final day of this production's run — who's to say he won't write another? With a libretto by Paul Griffiths, this one-act opera is a philosophical ghost story: Six people crawl from the wreckage of a car crash and reconstruct their relationships, unaware that they are dead. Christopher Alden directs, and Jeffrey Milarsky conducts Axiom, a Juilliard ensemble, which fills out the program with a handful of Mr. Carter's chamber works. Friday and Saturday night at 8, Sunday at 2, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students.

Saturday and earlier on Sunday, the barge becomes an opera house of sorts, when Ransom Wilson conducts four performances of "Mice War: An Opera for Kids," by the eclectic composer David Chesky. Mr. Peskanov and Mr. Schub perform Friday at 8 and Sunday at 4; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ (Friday only).

At 8, Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, Manhattan, counterinduction.com; $15 suggested donation. (Kozinn)★ 'DELUSION OF THE FURY' (Friday and Saturday night) This 90-minute music-theater piece adapted from Japanese Noh plays and an African folk tale was a breakthrough work for the eclectic American composer, music theorist and instrument builder Harry Partch, who died in 1974. But after the 1969 premiere at the University of California, Los Angeles, it was never performed again. Until now. Japan Society has commissioned a restaging of this tender, imaginative and humane work. The performers include a roster of gifted young dancers who also sing, and the members of Newband, an impressive ensemble devoted to performing Partch's music and maintaining the beautiful, elaborate instruments he built to play his microtonal scores. At 7:30, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org; sold out. (Tommasini)★ ENSEMBLE ACJW (Friday) It may be hard to remember the name Ensemble ACJW, the shorthand moniker of the chamber group made up of gifted postgraduate musicians from the new training academy run by Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School and the Weill Music Institute. But you are likely to remember the group's concerts, since the players are top-notch and the programming adventurous. Friday's concert offers Takemitsu's "Tree Line," Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and, of special interest, a major work by Reinbert de Leeuw, "In the Lovely Month of May."  At 7, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15. (Tommasini)GRIEG FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Sunday) News from up north arrives this weekend at Zankel Hall.

(Kozinn)★ NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Friday and Sunday) Clara Longstreth, the music director of this estimable group, has a proven gift for conceiving intriguing programs, including the chorus's holiday concert this weekend. Called "Choral Classics of Our Time," the program presents works written between 1935 and 2005 that draw on visionary and mystical texts, ranging from Russian liturgy to Shaker hymns. "Make Me a World" by the notable Canadian composer Ruth Watson Henderson will receive its New York premiere.

He comes to the Philharmonic this morning and Saturday night, and this time with some standard repertory: the Beethoven Third Piano Concerto. Philippe Jordan is the guest conductor and gives over the rest of the program to things Czech: excerpts from Smetana's work "Ma Vlast" and Dvorak's "Czech Suite." On Thursday the pianist Hélène Grimaud is the featured artist in a program of Ibert's "Hommage à Mozart," Ravel's Piano Concerto in G and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 4.

Jack Martin was among the throng watching a breaking battle, or dance competition, at the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival."It totally blew my mind," said Mr. Martin, 33, the assistant coordinator of young adult services for the New York Public Library. "We were all just, like, 'We've gotta get this into the library.'"Little did he know: Breaking, the individualistic, physical form of dancing born in the South Bronx in the late 1970s as part of an explosion of hip-hop culture, has been a fixture at the library for decades, ever since a pioneering generation of entrepreneurial-minded B-boys brought the art form down to Fifth Avenue just below 42nd Street in the early '80s. It was one of the first points of infiltration for what has since become a cherished staple of Manhattan street culture. Various crews have performed in front of the Humanities and Social Sciences Library in Midtown ever since, wowing tourists and New Yorkers alike with their short, thrilling shows under the steady gaze of the stone lions.Street performing is rewarding but demanding, its practitioners say; it's a tough way to earn a living, and many people move on after a few years. For a few, though, it is a way of life. Two of these lifers, Wayne Blizzard and Douglas Walker — who began performing on the streets as teenagers around 1980 — will be honored on Wednesday night when the library presents "Break! @ the Bronx Library Center" at its South Bronx branch.These two men, Harlem residents and members of the original Executioners crew, which helped bring breaking to Manhattan, have traveled to far-flung locales like Morocco and Japan on the strength of their art. That art  includes music: Mr. Walker says his new album, "Street Anthemz," is about to be released in Japan on his label, Flex Wreck Chords. But they have never stopped dancing on the streets. They now call themselves the Float Committee and work with a fluctuating collection of performers. Mr. Blizzard describes his style as old school, focusing on fast, slick footwork, while Mr. Walker also incorporates power moves, like windmills and back flips."Some people did it for a day," Mr. Blizzard said. "But we got into it for the future, for our life and our jobs."Referring to subsequent generations, he added: "Everybody dancing on the streets now knows me. They either danced with me or I showed them the ropes."Female "hitters," as street dancers are sometimes called, have increased in number since the early days, but they remain rare. Ana Garcia, better known as Rokafella and half of Full Circle Productions with her husband and fellow breaker, Kwikstep, said she "earned her stripes" on the streets, and it was her idea to honor the Executioners. Full Circle will perform on Wednesday, and Rokafella has served as the library's liaison, giving breaking workshops at the Bronx Library Center. Mr. Martin said he hoped some of her students would participate in a relaxed minibattle as part of the evening."To me it's a tribe," Rokafella said of hitters, adding with a laugh: "I believe this is the longest show on Broadway. It's outlasted every production, and it's not on strike."But Rokafella also knew the life wasn't for her, citing police harassment and the expectations, often sexual, that male dancers had about her. "I loved being a part of something; I loved the moves," she said. "I fell out of love with it when I saw how the police were treating us and how the other dancers were looking at me."These issues remain today, Mr. Walker and Mr. Blizzard said, as do the problems of permits and fines that make it increasingly difficult for performers. But for them, the pleasures still outweigh the pains."It's freedom," said Mr. Walker, who moved back to New York three years ago after about a decade in Japan, where he performed on the streets and worked as a music producer. (His Web site is myspace.com/dougflex.) He does not dance as much as he used to, handling more of the music side of things.Nevertheless, on a recent Saturday afternoon Mr. Walker and a crew of four dancers, including the Michael Jackson impersonator Steven Clark, could be found setting up near the lion statues in front of the library. A crowd quickly assembled, and it wasn't long before a typically impatient New Yorker was asking when the performance would start."Right now," Mr. Clark said. And they began to dance.LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6 — Amy Winehouse, the British soul singer whose battles with addiction have turned her into a tabloid regular, drew six Grammy nominations, including nods for the four marquee categories, today  as the contenders for the 50th annual awards ceremony were announced.Ms. Winehouse, who scored a hit with her modern twist on soul music but who has repeatedly canceled performances in recent months as she clashed with personal demons, received nominations for album of the year, for "Back to Black" (Universal Republic),  as well as for record and song of the year for the self-referential hit single, "Rehab," about her refusal to enter treatment.The 24-year-old singer, whose well-publicized troubles prompted doubts about how Grammy voters would view her, will also be in contention for the trophy for best new artist when the awards are handed out Feb. 10 at the Staples Center arena in Los Angeles in a broadcast on CBS.Although Ms. Winehouse was the only performer to appear in all four of the most prestigious  categories, she fell short of drawing the most nominations over all. That distinction went to the rap star Kanye West, who led the field with eight nominations, including his  nomination for album of the year for the third CD in his college-themed trilogy, "Graduation." Mr. West's nominations also included those for best rap album and best rap song as a co-writer of the  "Good Life."The biggest surprise of the day may have been the relatively low profile of Bruce Springsteen, whose new album, "Magic," with the E Street Band, had been hailed by critics as a return to his classic rock style. Mr. Springsteen did draw four nominations, but none in the marquee categories. "Magic" had been seen as a favorite for the album of the year category, which Mr. Springsteen has never won.Instead, the album of the year field included surprise entries from recordings far removed from the pop mainstream, including the country singer Vince Gill's "These Days," and the jazz composer Herbie Hancock's "River: the Joni Letters." In addition to Ms. Winehouse and Mr. West, the competition will include the new album "'Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace"   from a previous Grammy favorite, the Foo Fighters.Likewise, the list of best new artist contenders — four female solo performers and a female-fronted band — yielded some unexpected names, including the R&B singer Ledisi and the pop-punk act Paramore. (Not all the contenders were exactly new: Paramore garnered fame this year with its second major album, as did Feist, the Canadian singer-songwriter who has previously performed with the indie-rock band Broken Social Scene). The teenage country star Taylor Swift rounded out the field.The nominations came as the event's organizers, the National Academy of Recordings Arts and  Sciences, are aiming to add weight to the ceremony, which over the years has come under fire for hewing too closely to the music industry's commercial priorities. Grammy organizers already have undertaken an effort to create a historic feel for the event, including the broadcast of a two-hour special on CBS last week, "My Night at the Grammy's," spotlighting past performances, and the creation of a seven-CD series collecting Grammy-winning songs from the major genre fields.Although the academy did not disclose who might be performing on the broadcast, critics expect it to use the 50th anniversary as a rationale to enlist any number of high-wattage past Grammy stars. Such celebrity drawing power might be pivotal if the academy hopes to sustain its recent ratings rebound — and offset the risk of this year's field of leading nominees, some of whom who may be obscure to mainstream viewers.After a weak showing two years ago, according to Nielsen Media Research, the Grammy broadcast jumped roughly 18 percent in last year's ratings, drawing an estimated 20 million people.Piano competitions have snowballed to such an extent that like musicians, they need to fight to retain their competitive edge in a crowded field. According to program notes for the recital on Monday at Zankel Hall by Alexander Ghindin, winner of the 2007 Cleveland International Piano Competition, that event was one of "only 31" piano contests to have received a five-star rating out of the more than 400 surveyed in Piano Competitions Worldwide, a book  published in 2003.Awarding multiple honors each, those hundreds of competitions produce veritable armies of prize winners, most with stellar technique, who must continue to battle one another for limited performing opportunities after their competition-sponsored concerts are over. The Cleveland competition, which offers prizes including a $50,000 cash award to its winner, presented Mr. Ghindin on Monday in his New York recital debut.A 30-year-old Russian, Mr. Ghindin has been on the international competition circuit since 1994, when he placed fourth in the Tchaikovsky Competition. On Monday he offered a varied program of Schumann, Liszt, Stravinsky and the American premiere of the appealing "Sonatine Concertante" (2005) by Rodion Shchedrin, who succeeded Shostakovich as president of the Union of Composers of the Russian Federation.Mr. Shchedrin's piece, written as a birthday present to his wife, the Bolshoi ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, opened with gentle two-note staccato figures echoing between the two hands and progressed to a faster, almost jazzy middle section before returning to the staccato theme.Mr. Ghindin began the concert in the nursery, with Schumann's "Kinderszenen" ("Scenes From Childhood"), and ended it conquering the devilish demands of Liszt's Sonata in B minor, the highlight of the evening. His fingers blurring across the keys in Liszt's tricky octave passages, he easily surmounted the work's ferocious technical demands. Equally important, he fully conveyed its lyrical beauty, playing with introspection and an assured, singing tone.There were some lovely moments in the Schumann, as in the evocative "Traumerei," although in other movements Mr. Ghindin's interpretation lacked the essential childhood ingredients of whimsy and playfulness. The program also included Stravinsky's "Three Movements From Petrouchka," played with steely panache, although at times it could have been more exuberantly colorful.The enthusiastic audience was rewarded with three encores: Prokofiev's "Suggestion Diabolique," Siloti's transcription of a Bach prelude and Schulz-Evler's "Blue Danube" Arabesques.THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF RECORDING ARTS & SCIENCES, INC.Final Nominations List50th Annual GRAMMY® AwardsFor recordings released during the Eligibility Year October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007Note: More or less than 5 nominations in a category is the result of ties.General FieldCategory 1 -  Record Of The Year(Award to the Artist and to the Producer(s), Recording Engineer(s) and/or Mixer(s), if other than the artist.)• IrreplaceableBeyoncéBeyoncé Knowles, S.

"Someone said, 'You're writing a book for kids about silent French films?'" he recalled. "'That sounds terrible.'"Fortunately, readers didn't agree. This "novel in words and pictures," published by Scholastic last winter, became a children's best seller. Set in Paris in 1931, it centers on the adventures of its title character, a 12-year-old orphan solving a mystery involving his own past and that of the cinema — specifically the work of the early French filmmaker Georges Méliès. The novel teems with cinematic references, and this weekend Mr. Selznick will visit the Museum of the Moving Image for its "Magic, Music, and Early Movies," a festival including an "Invention of Hugo Cabret" celebration."Images from the book will be projected on a screen," said Mr. Selznick, who will read from his work. "I've set it up to exciting monster-movie music from the '50s." The presentation, at 2 p.m. tomorrow and Sunday, will be followed by shorts by Méliès, accompanied by live music by Sxip Shirey. These will include "A Trip to the Moon" (1902), above, which plays a pivotal role in "Hugo" and is "considered the first science-fiction movie," Mr. Selznick said.Children attending the presentation can join workshops to make one of the earliest forms of moving pictures: a flip book. Images — here, digital prints — are organized into a book; when the pages are flipped, the images appear to move. Scavenger hunts for cinematic art and artifacts will also be held.In addition to his "Hugo" presentation Mr. Selznick will introduce other historical screening programs throughout the weekend. And he expects them to interest children just as much. "They're different from what kids are exposed to now," he said of the early films. "But they're funny and they're weird, and kids respond to that." (At 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-4520, movingimage.us. "Hugo" presentation: $10; $7 for members; includes museum admission. Workshops, 1 and 3:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, an additional $5. Preregistration advised.) LAUREL GRAEBER  'AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS' (SaturdaySaturday) A disabled boy offers the baby Jesus the gift of his crutches in this 1951 opera by Gian Carlo Menotti, which has become a Christmas favorite. The Little Orchestra Society's annual production features not only the child, the Magi and the other star players, but also live animals onstage. At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 971-9500, littleorchestra.org; $10 to $40.'ARCHAEOLOGY ZONE: DISCOVERING TREASURES FROM PLAYGROUNDS TO PALACES' (SaturdaySaturday through Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this new exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle, and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show also includes a recreated home from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. (Through June 15, 2009.) Saturday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., and Thursday to 8 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12, members and for all on Saturdays.'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (Saturdayand Sunday) As Charlotte writes in her web, Wilbur is "some pig." He sure is. In this musical adaptation of E. B. White's classic, presented by the Pied Piper Children's Theater of NYC, he can sing and dance. (Through Dec. 16.) Saturday at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Holy Trinity Church, 20 Cumming Street, near Dyckman Street, Inwood, (212) 544-2976; $8; $6 for under 16 and 65+.'LA CUCARACHITA MARTINA' ('MARTINA, THE LITTLE ROACH') (Saturday and Sunday) Cockroaches are people too. Well, at least they are in this production, presented in an easy-to-understand mix of Spanish and English by Teatro SEA, which specializes in Latino theater for children. Its heroine, Martina, is a tiny cutie who is nonetheless much bigger than anything scurrying around your basement. But not to worry: She's a bunraku-style puppet, seeking true love. At 3 p.m., Pregones Theater, 571-575 Walton Avenue, between East 149th and 150th Streets, South Bronx, (212) 529-1545, sea-online.info; $15; $12.50 for 2 to 12; free for under 2.'CUT TO THE CHASE' (Friday  through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This is an appropriate title for a show in which no words are wasted: Parallel Exit, a vaudevillian company, creates theater inspired by the silent films of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But while there's no dialogue, there are plenty of sound effects. If this backstage farce is anything like the troupe's 2005 "This Way That Way," it should be hilarious. (Through Dec. 30.) Friday , Saturday night and Tuesday through Thursday nights at 7:15; Sunday at 2:15 and 5:15 p.m., 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59E59.org; $35; $24.50 for members; $15 for children and 65+.'CYBERCHASE: THE CHASE IS ON!' (Friday  through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Children tend to love the cyberworld, but they don't always love math. The two are inventively combined in the PBS animated series "Cyberchase" and in this exhibition at the New York Hall of Science, which is based on the television show and presents puzzles and games that turn fractions, algebra, geometry and other mathematical subjects into fun. It is also the hall's first bilingual (English and Spanish) show. (Through Jan. 21.) From 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday ; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday; 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nyscience.org. Free with admission: $11; $8 for ages 2 through 17, students and 62+; free for under 2. Free to all on Fridays from 2 to 5 p.m. and on Sundays from 10 to 11 a.m.DINOSAUR ENCOUNTER (Daily) The Staten Island Zoo is going to look a lot like Jurassic Park for the next several weeks, thanks to Kokoro Dinosaurs, a Los Angeles company that makes life-size robotic models of these prehistoric creatures. Expect to see species including the apatosaurus, the pteranodon and the tenontosaurus — moving and vocalizing — at this exhibition, as well as their present-day descendants in the zoo's new 13,500-square-foot reptile wing. (Through Jan. 13.) From 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., 614 Broadway, Willowbrook, (718) 442-3100, statenislandzoo.org; $4 in addition to zoo admission: $7; $5 for 60+; $4 for 3 to 14; free for members and under 3.'DIVINE VOICE: THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF J. S. BACH' (Sunday) The cellist Steven Isserlis is back at the 92nd Street Y, leading the Family Music series, concerts for ages 6 and older that enable children not just to hear great composers but also to understand their inspirations. Here he tackles Bach, with a 10-piece string ensemble including a harpsichord. At 3 p.m., Kaufmann Concert Hall, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $16.'A DOLPHIN UP A TREE!' (Saturday and Sunday) The only dolphins around New York can be found in the water, typically in the aquarium on Coney Island. But these days at least one member of the species occupies a far more unusual position: up a tree in Manhattan. The title character in this show by Kimberly Foster (book and lyrics) and John Fleming (music and lyrics) is actually a little girl named Tina, and she has far more to worry about than just being beached in some branches. For ages 2 to 8, the musical is in an open-ended run. At 10:30 a.m. and noon, the DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200; $20.'DON'T TREAD ON ME: THE REVOLUTIONARY PLAYS' (Friday  through Sunday) Academy Award-winning actresses don't often star in plays by children, but Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for "Fargo," will be among the professionals in this staging of short plays by 9- to 12-year-olds. The nine young playwrights, all from the Clinton neighborhood, took part in a program of the 52nd Street Project that offers them instruction in writing and their own dramaturges. Friday  at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., the American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 642-5052; free, but reservations are required.FUNKEY MONKEYS (Saturday and Sunday) These aren't zoo residents but a band formed by Joshua Sitron, composer and musical director for the Nickelodeon show "Dora the Explorer." The members make up stories and do comic bits along with their music, which is funky of course. And their intended audience — those 2 to 8 — can participate in their new show, playing in an open-ended run. At 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, funkeymonkeys.com; $20.'THE GAZILLION BUBBLE SHOW' (Friday  through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Children love bubbles, and Ana Yang, in this interactive show, promises not just a gazillion but also some of the largest ever blown (her husband, Fan Yang, holds the world record), along with light effects and lasers. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (Through Jan. 25.) Friday  at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 11 a.m. and 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 3 p.m.; Tuesday at 7 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 2 and 7 p.m.,  New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, gazillionbubbleshow.com; $41.50 to $86.50.HANUKKAHTHON (Sunday and Monday) When the Jewish Maccabees defeated the Syrian Greeks about 165 B.C., they rededicated their temple. At this Hanukkah celebration at the Children's Galleries for Jewish Culture, young revelers can build their own. Model temples will be made from balsa wood, and menorahs and dreidels from foam core. Children can also join a Hanukkah treasure hunt. From 2 to 5 p.m., 515 West 20th Street, No. 4E, Chelsea, (212) 924-4500; $8.'A KID'S LIFE!' (Saturday and Sunday) Instead of Starsky and Hutch, you have Starsky and Zach — Zach is a 5-year-old, and Starsky is a golden retriever — in this musical about, well, a kid's life. With a book by Cynthia Riddle and Peter Hunziker, and music and lyrics by Corey Leland, the show follows the pair as they meet Zoe, a new girl in town, and a host of other characters. (Through Jan. 13.) Saturday at 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., Sunday at 12:30 p.m., the York Theater, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, akidslife.com; $20 to $60.'KIDS & YIDDISH: ODE TO OY!' (Sunday) The Village People meet the Chosen People in this annual holiday revue, which combines sendups of popular culture with lighthearted instruction in Yiddish. This year's edition has a skit about colors ("Gray's Anatomy") and a routine about a ventriloquist's puppet who strikes out on her own. (She's no dummy.) The show always involves children, both onstage and in the audience. Sundays at 11 a.m. through Dec. 30, the JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, 212-279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $20; $17 for 12 and under.)'THE LITTLE MERMAID' (Saturday and Sunday) This musical adaptation, from Literally Alive Children's Theater, preserves Hans Christian Andersen's distinctly not happily-ever-after ending, but it is far from a somber affair. With music by Mark McGee and book and lyrics by Brenda Bell, it includes rousing numbers like a rafter-rattling blues turn by the Fish Witch. Children can also help decorate the stage by taking part in a preshow art workshop. Workshop ($5) at 11 a.m., show at noon, the Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 866-5170, literallyalive.com; $25; $20 for children.'THE LITTLEST LIGHT ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE' (Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday) You'd better believe that this littlest light will be made to shine in this new musical from Vital Children's Theater. Based on the animated feature of the same title, the show features a discarded Christmas bulb and a fatherless 8-year-old named Timmy. As you might imagine, a holiday blackout is involved. (Through Jan. 6.) Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Wednesday at 11 a.m., McGinn-Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 352-3101, vitaltheatre.org; $18.'MAX & RUBY' (Friday  through Sunday) Ruby is 7, and Max is her little brother, and though they have fur and long ears (they're rabbits), their responses to the world aren't much different from those of their little human counterparts. In this new musical from Theaterworks/USA, based on the television show of the same title (in turn based on the Max and Ruby book series by Rosemary Wells), the siblings want to put on a play for Grandma, and comic complications ensue. (Through Jan. 13.) Friday  at 6 p.m., Saturday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; $25.MENORAH MANIA! (Sunday through Wednesday) Never mind the coming Super Bowl; the big event at the Jewish Children's Museum these days is the Dreidel Tournament. On Sunday at 1:30 p.m. devoted teams of dreidel spinners will have a showdown, complete with playoffs and prizes. It's part of "Menorah Mania!," a celebration of Hanukkah that also includes meeting the ancient warrior Judah Maccabee (Sunday and Monday), and enjoying Hanukkah crafts, films and a game show (Sunday through Wednesday). From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., 792 Eastern Parkway, at Kingston Avenue, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 467-0600, jcm.museum.

The boy hero of the book "Flat Stanley" by Jeff Brown, Stanley loses his three-dimensionality when a bulletin board falls on him. But he just merrily mails himself around the world, having exotic adventures while searching for a way to regain his normal shape. He arrives in TriBeCa Saturday in a musical adaptation. At 1:30 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+.'THE MYTHS AND MAGIC OF ICELAND: A VOYAGE THROUGH ICELANDIC CHILDREN'S LITERATURE' (Saturday) American children know all about fairies, trolls and elves, but what about huldufolk (hidden people)? They are just some of the magical Icelandic characters to be discovered in this installation at Scandinavia House, a combination reading room, performance space and play area, designed by Sarah Edkins. (Through March 29.) At 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, scandinaviahouse.org, (212) 847-9740. The installation is open to the public on Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m. for $5 per child; it is free to members of the American-Scandinavian Foundation Tuesdays through Saturdays.THE NEW SHANGHAI CIRCUS (Friday  through Sunday) The circus is in town again, this time from China. And while some of the troupe's acts derive from harvest festivals celebrated 2,000 years ago, there is nothing dated about its feats, which include acrobatics, cycling, juggling and magic.
