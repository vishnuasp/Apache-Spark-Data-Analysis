1. FEIST: 'THE REMINDER' (Cherry Tree/Interscope). Her modest, beguiling CD is full of carefully composed songs that sound like happy accidents. And even after a ubiquitous iPod commercial, that famous first line — "1-2-3-4 tell me that you love me more" — still sounds inviting. In a year with shockingly few big albums, Feist made the best small one.2. TURF TALK: 'WEST COAST VACCINE: THE CURE' (30/30/Sick Wid' It). This unsung Vallejo, Calif., rapper outdid the competition by stretching elastic braggadocio over a wild collection of whirring, thwacking beats. Never underestimate the power of pure impudence: "My pants sag, your mama always knock us/So I lift my T-shirt and show her my boxers."3. PANDA BEAR: 'PERSON PITCH' (Paw Tracks). A lovely, dizzying solo album by Noah Lennox, from Animal Collective, who mixed rich vocal harmonies with woozy electronic rhythms. It sounds dreamy, but the plainspoken lyrics are rooted in daily pleasures and frustrations: "There's a reason that I work so hard at this stuff/When all I want to do is take it easy."4. JOE NICHOLS: 'REAL THINGS' (Universal South). He filled his album with slow songs, then checked into rehab soon after it arrived. Those are two reasons that Mr. Nichols didn't rule country radio in 2007. But "Real Things" is a low-key triumph, by turns wry and sentimental. "I'm still goin' through my whiskey years," he purrs, neither bragging nor apologizing.5. UGK: 'UNDERGROUND KINGZ' (Jive/Zomba). A slick, sprawling double CD from the hugely influential Port Arthur, Tex., duo of Bun B and Pimp C: ruthless raps and retrofitted soul songs, cruel pimp-talk and thoughtful observations. Some fans said it was too long, too much. But on Dec. 4 Pimp C was found dead in a hotel room; now all we want is more.6. TRACEY THORN: 'OUT OF THE WOODS' (Astralwerks). The year's most pleasant surprise: After a five-year absence the singer from Everything but the Girl returned with a beautiful solo album that expands the boundaries of grown-up pop. Gleaming dance tracks, glimmering ballads: How did this CD stay a secret?7. JENS LEKMAN: 'NIGHT FALLS OVER KORTEDALA' (Secretly Canadian). This mild-mannered Swedish indie-rocker is also a shameless flirt, an alternate-universe disco star, a witty raconteur and a first-rate crooner. Never underestimate the power of pure ambivalence: "Sometimes I almost regret it, like I regret my regrets/I see myself on my deathbed saying, 'I wish I would have loved less.' "8. PROJECT PAT: 'WALKIN' BANK ROLL' (Koch). Scarcely a year after his last CD, this Memphis rapper returned with an exuberant indie-label release. The eerie, meticulous beats — by Juicy J (his brother) and DJ Paul, both of Three 6 Mafia — cleverly echo Project Pat's dichotomous approach: grim subject matter, whimsical delivery. His version of a drug dealer's boast: "I got that bull frog — ribbit!"9. MARNIE STERN: 'IN ADVANCE OF THE BROKEN ARM' (Kill Rock Stars). A fierce, joyful rock record from a bedroom shredder. Yawping and tapping her fretboard, Ms. Stern revels in maximalism; her debut album is, in two different ways, a blast.10. THE-DREAM: 'LOVE/HATE' (Island Def Jam). In which Terius Nash, the songwriter behind Rihanna's "Umbrella" and J. Holiday's "Bed" recommits himself to gooey, robotic '80s-influenced R&B. He calls himself The-Dream, and his debut album captured the ecstatic sound of pop radio in 2007.Top SongsRIHANNA "Umbrella" (Def Jam)R. KELLY FEATURING T.I.

JOSHUA REDMAN: 'BACK EAST' (Nonesuch). A tenor saxophone-bass-drums trio in jazz means a rugged structural challenge, and possibly an exercise in nostalgia, as it was more or less trademarked and sewed up by Sonny Rollins 50 years ago. But when it's done this well, you can forget about all the other things jazz could or should be doing. Here Mr. Redman compresses his goals, leaves distractions behind and makes the most agile and personal record of his career.2. GILBERTO GIL: 'GIL LUMINOSO' (DRG). This is the album I have listened to most: a master Brazilian singer-songwriter, alone with guitar, sanding down old and new songs to the core. Few records are as beautiful.3.  ROBERT PLANT AND ALISON KRAUSS: 'RAISING SAND' (Rounder). Both doing something quite different from what they're known for — Mr. Plant singing quietly and in harmony, Ms. Krauss singing blues — these two can make sense of, and even melt themselves into, the  foggy gothic-Americana  atmosphere of T Bone Burnett's production.4. BILL MCHENRY: 'ROSES' (Sunnyside). Jazz at its best is always both old-fashioned and modern, and the saxophonist Bill McHenry is a good example. He plays with unabashed enthusiasm for melody:  no mazes of harmony or time signature here; the warm, sweet lines ripely tumble out, dictating the band's rhythm as they go.5. NO AGE: 'WEIRDO RIPPERS' (Fat Cat). A sneaky and suspect band: what are these two Los Angeles art-punks up to, with their ground-level competence, low-fidelity smears, whiny vocals, song after song of twinkly, echoey noise-into-song? They're confusing you, with charisma.6. FEIST: 'THE REMINDER' (Cherry Tree/Interscope). Leslie Feist is a pop singer, but plenty of jazz singers would have loved to make a record this good. It's well-arranged, generous, strong in melody, charismatic, genuine and judicious almost to the point of frugality. What's not to like?7. SAM YAHEL TRIO: 'TRUTH AND BEAUTY' (Origin). Here's Joshua Redman again, on tenor saxophone, in a sporadic, long-running jazz trio led by the organist Sam Yahel, with Brian Blade on drums. This record overcomes old organ-and-tenor jazz clichés so easily that you hardly think of them. The music is fluid, flexible, all parts running together, the groove overwhelming.8. KARTET: 'THE BAY WINDOW' (Songlines). The idea of the mind-body split is old nonsense,  but if you've ever thought you feel or enjoy jazz through the intellect, you've got to hear this French quartet. There are older-jazz echoes here — Thelonious Monk, Lee Konitz — but three of these four musicians are composers, and this quiet record is loaded with new-sounding purpose. The music is  tense, detailed and well practiced.9. ALICIA KEYS: 'AS I AM' (J  Records). This is new R&B as new R&B, with no deeper guiding philosophy. But these cagey, obsessive songs on the good old themes of innocence and experience can grow on you wickedly, and some of the grooves, whether electronic or live band, are deep enough to roast a pig in.10. NINA NASTASIA AND JIM WHITE: 'YOU FOLLOW ME' (Fat Cat). The American Ms. Nastasia writes songs about love, doubt and fear and sings them with acoustic guitar; the Australian Mr. White plays drums in sketchy, painterly phrases. It's a concise, mysterious record.Top SongsRIHANNA "Umbrella" (Def Jam)VON SüDENFED "The Rhinohead" (Domino)SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA "Sácala Bailar" (Six Degrees)CAFé TACUBA "Volver a Comenzar" (Universal Latino)JESU "Conqueror" (Hydra Head)A GROUP of environmentally concerned friends in San Francisco got together on Jan.  1, 2006, and decided to "flee the consumer grid," vowing not to buy anything new for at least the next 12 months."The premise was simple: barter, borrow or buy secondhand for a year — food, drink, health and safety necessities excluded," Zachary Slobig writes in Good. "Yes, they could buy toilet paper and new underwear, but, say, a gallon of white house paint or new dog toys? Unacceptable."From that idea, a consumer movement has been born. Some 9,000 people worldwide have signed up to do the same thing. They call themselves the Compact, in homage to the Mayflower Compact, the 1620 social contract drawn up by the Pilgrims who vowed to build a better life in the New World.While saving money is a pleasant byproduct — one woman who has been part of the group from the beginning estimates she has saved "$4,000 during her period of abstinence" — members of the Compact are mainly trying  to reduce the amount of trash they generate.As Mr. Slobig writes: "Americans generated 24.6 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2005 — a 60 percent increase since 1980 — and more than half of that mass went into 1,654 landfills. That is like a fleet of 1,800 Queen Mary 2 cruise ships being buried every year."GIFT IDEA 1 If you are still uncertain what to give for the holidays, Worth magazine has a suggestion."The Dutch architect Janjapp Ruijssenaars  has designed a bed that will have you floating on air — literally," Jennifer O'Reilly writes. "For $1.6 million, customers can purchase the buoyant bed, which is held about 16 inches off the ground by magnets within and beneath it that repel each other."Four wires tie the bed to the floor.A "miniversion," which floats three inches off the ground, is available for a mere $160,000."Though Ruijssenaars assures buyers that the bed is safe, those with metallic medical devices such as pacemakers should not venture below," Ms. O'Reilly writes. "They might find themselves more attached to their new bed than they would like."GIFT IDEAS 2, 3 AND MORE The Robb Report gift guide is filled with ideas that most of us can only fantasize about —  fabulous cars (like  the $250,000 Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione ) humongous boats (there is a 459-foot six-deck yacht that starts at $250 million) and dazzling jewelry (a 300-carat diamond necklace for a minimum of $16 million.)Our favorites: A  carousel that features 30 horses, a lion, tiger and zebra (oh, my) that will be arranged three deep, will "stand from four to six feet tall" and will bounce on a mechanism powered by an electric motor.It comes  with a 14-foot-tall calliope to  provide the music. It will take a minimum of 18 months to design, carve and build. So it might be best to think of this as a Christmas present for 2009. And then there is a one-of-a-kind 18.5-foot-long exact scale (1:48) model of the Titanic that  weighs 1,500 pounds "and features teak decking and signage that is accurate and, in some cases, legible only when viewed through a magnifying glass."It took seven people working full time for seven years — "three years longer than it took to complete the 882-foot ship." Price: $2.5 million.FINAL TAKE The following tidbits come courtesy of Harper's:¶Americans lose about $8 billion annually by not redeeming gift cards.¶FedEx transported  11,854 Christmas trees  last year to American  troops.¶When asked if they believed the children who say they have been good during the last year, only 54 percent of shopping mall and party Santas said "yes."PAUL B. BROWNKIRK FRANKLIN"The Fight of My Life"(Fo Yo Soul/Zomba Gospel)A decade ago, when the gospel star Kirk Franklin — joined by the God's Property choir and Salt, from Salt 'N' Pepa — had a crossover hit with "Stomp," it seemed that updated gospel music might be reaching an accommodation with mainstream hip-hop and R&B. And why not? Since many (probably most) rappers and R&B stars are Christians, and since the genres share so much musical history, it seems inevitable in retrospect that a brash young man of God would storm the pop charts.But the presence of "Stomp" on secular radio wasn't really a sign of things to come. Gospel remains separate from the pop mainstream, and these days Mr. Franklin is definitely a gospel star, not a pop star. But he loves to present himself as a hip-hop-generation maverick who's not afraid to shock the old folks in service of reaching the young ones. A few years ago he sat down with Oprah Winfrey to explain how he overcame his addiction to pornography. And during a recent interview he said, "There's nothing weak about me, just 'cause I'm a Jesus cat."Mr. Franklin's new album is "The Fight of My Life," and it works, when it works, because of his manic energy. The first single, "Declaration (This Is It!)," uses an old Kenny Loggins song as the basis for a thumping track that's halfway between hip-hop and go-go; the video, echoing the album cover, stars Mr. Franklin as a boxer. (That's one way to sneak a bare chest into a gospel video.) He sings a little and raps a little, but he really excels at interjection, narration and peroration.Mr. Franklin always lays it on thick, but this album sometimes sounds a bit thin. A hip-hop track called "I Like Me" could almost be a parody (one defensive boast: "I got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp"), and the R&B is pretty wan. But "I Am God," with the Christian-rock star tobyMac (formerly of dc Talk), is a worrisome rap-rock collision that eventually takes flight, thanks to a soaring chorus and a divine showdown — and thanks too to a hip-pop gospel maximalist who sounds best when he's going way over the top. KELEFA SANNEH JOSH GROBAN"Noël" (Reprise)Listening to "Noël," Josh Groban's blockbuster seasonal album,  you can easily imagine yourself inside one of the world's largest cathedrals at midnight on Christmas Eve. As Mr. Groban's pure, high baritone lifts to the heavens, buoyed by the London Symphony Orchestra and choirs of angels, you are transported halfway to the stars. If the sound is a little swampy here, a little drum-heavy there, the album sustains a mood of grand, churchy reverence with pop leanings (those drums and guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Faith Hill).But unless you detest all things traditional, Mr. Groban is a reassuring throwback to a less aggressive pop era when eccentric self-expression wasn't the be-all and end-all. The vocal embodiment of ceremonial formality, he sings without affectation in a beautiful, pitch-perfect voice that at its most incandescent recalls the great operatic tenor Jussi Bjoerling (but with a microphone). He refuses to embellish melodies with flowery melismas. He never sobs. He doesn't swing or rock out.The most flagrant contemporary touches are the recorded holiday messages from military personnel in Iraq and greetings by family members to soldiers overseas that punctuate "I'll Be Home for Christmas." There is a generic contemporary ballad, "Thankful," with music by David Foster (the album's producer) and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager, that recalls John Bucchino's far superior song, "Grateful."In a lubricious pop climate that sexualizes even Santa Claus, his attitude is chaste, his tone elevated. By contrast Mr. McKnight, who joins him in "Angels We Have Heard on High," and Ms. Hill, who strains to add country-gospel flavor to "The First Noël," sound coarse and egotistical. Mr. Groban maintains the role of prodigious choirboy leading a solemn candlelit processional on the high road to the altar. STEPHEN HOLDENEINSTüRZENDE NEUBAUTEN"Alles Wieder Offen"(Potomak, neubauten.org)While Radiohead was drawing headlines worldwide, the long-lived German band Einstürzende Neubauten quietly ran its own music-business experiment. Fans financed the recording of "Alles Wieder Offen" ("All Open Again") by paying upfront for the album in progress, then watching and communicating with the band — including giving musical advice — as it was recorded. (The organization ArtistShare, at artistshare.com, is doing something similar with other musicians and various kinds of participation.)Loyal listeners probably provided the main support for "Alles Wieder Offen," and the music and lyrics (in German, but packaged with English translations) do make some insider references to older songs. But the album doesn't play to a cult. "Alles Wieder Offen" welcomes newcomers.The album maintains Einstürzende Neubauten's longtime fixations: slow-building drones, metallic junk percussion, a foreboding tone and a darkly philosophical outlook: "I sing of our catastrophes/Intonate the breakdowns," Blixa Bargeld declares in his world-weary voice in "Susej." Yet the songs also have clear structures that verge on pop, and the arrangements use noise but also encompass delicacy, like the acoustic fingerpicking that ripples through "Ich Warte" ("I'm Waiting")."Die Wellen" ("The Waves"), which opens the album, pounds with steady, constantly thickening piano chords from beginning to end. "Unvollständigkeit" ("Incompleteness"), an insomniac's mutterings, carries an unyielding pulse and chant through transformations worthy of "A Day in the Life." But "Let's Do It a Dada" merges the band's beloved percussion clangor with a kind of haywire electropop that Timbaland might enjoy. Inviting fans into the making of the album apparently heartened the band enough to let a playful streak surface now and then amid all the seriousness. JON PARELESJOE BUDDEN"Mood Muzik III: For Better or for Worse"(mixtape)The New Jersey rapper Joe Budden released a self-titled CD on Def Jam Records in 2003. It was a tantalizing album, uneven but buoyed by some great rapping. He has a booming, textured voice, and he packs his stanzas full of intricate rhymes and unexpected references. Despite a hip-hop hit ("Pump It Up," which spawned a remix that let him go toe to toe with Jay-Z), the CD quickly faded, and so did its creator. Joe Budden has yet to release another album.What he has released instead is a series of mixtapes, all compiled by DJ OnPoint. They chronicle the (often) unhappy life of a witty and perceptive rapper who wonders if his big moment has come and gone. After "Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden" came 2005's "Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,"  which was full of brutally revealing rhymes. (In one track he owned up to mixed feelings about his new baby.) Now comes "Mood Muzik III," a mixtape — widely available online — that is scheduled to be rereleased as a retail album next year."Mood Muzik III" isn't as well-produced as its predecessor, which hid an unexpected sample of the neo-grunge band Staind among the hard, ominous beats. And some of the earnest R&B refrains on "III" wouldn't be missed if they had been, um, missed. But as usual Mr. Budden's verses are riveting. In "All of Me," he revisits a harrowing fight with a girlfriend:I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start toAnd then remember it takes two people to argueAll she do is provoke me, all I do is dis herAll I did was shake her, she say that I hit herAnd even when he's just issuing threats or bragging about his abilities, he seems preoccupied, obsessing over the success he still wants, the children he doesn't see, the feud he's already sick of. Listeners not well-versed in Jersey City hip-hop minutiae (or hip-hop in general, or sports, or celebrity gossip — the list goes on) might need to Google some of his punch lines.Maybe sometime in the enlightened future Mr. Budden's mixtape output will be reissued in a deluxe, well-footnoted boxed set. For now Philadelphia Eagles fans in particular may appreciate the way he sighingly says goodbye to former protégés: "Got to drop a few branches off my family tree/Raised my sons all wrong — guess I'm Andy Reid."

Although it is no longer part of AT&T, it has not been discontinued; it is now the research arm of Alcatel-Lucent. The column also misspelled the surname of the president of Arizona State University, who said that universities' roles in such partnerships would evolve in coming decades. He is Michael Crow, not Crowe.  (Go to Article)TravelAn article on Dec. 9 about Moscow as a new luxury destination misstated the cost of a ticket on the city's metro system in United States currency. The ticket, at 17 rubles, is about 70 cents, at the exchange rate of 25 rubles to the dollar; it is not 7 cents. A picture caption also misidentified the location of a Rolex billboard. It is in the plaza leading to Red Square; it is not in Red Square.

(Go to Article)An article last Sunday about the suicide of Megan Meier, who was the target of a hoax on MySpace, referred incorrectly to statements made by Lori Drew, a neighbor, through her lawyer. She has denied creating the MySpace page used in the hoax and has denied knowledge of the final messages, which are a suspected cause of Ms. Meier's suicide; she has not denied knowing about the ongoing hoax.  (Go to Article)The Field Notes column last Sunday, about new forms of wedding entertainment, referred incorrectly to "Big Spender," which was sung at a wedding as part of a selection of music from Broadway. It is from "Sweet Charity," not "Chicago." The article also rendered incorrectly the Web site for In Any Event, a wedding planner in New York. It is inanyevent.biz, not inanyevent.net, the site for a Santa Barbara, Calif., planner.  (Go to Article)Real EstateThe "In the Region" article in New Jersey copies on Dec. 9 about street design within two new housing complexes in Jersey City referred incorrectly to two train stops. A train stop near the Liberty Harbor development provides access to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system — not the PATH system — and is at Jersey Avenue. (There is no Avenue B.) A PATH stop within walking distance of the Hamilton Square development is called the Grove Street station. (There is no Seventh Street station.)

And it reminds you that social history airbrushed for the screen by Hollywood is preferable to none at all. Despite its cosmetic embellishments, "The Great Debaters" obviously emanates from the heart. It makes you nostalgic for prototypes like Stanley Kramer's socially conscious message movies of the 1950s and '60s and for the era that produced them.As an enduring American myth, the triumph of the sanctified underdog, an intrepid spirit who doesn't compromise his integrity on the slippery path to victory, may be much the worse for wear in these Darwinian times, but it can still produce a lump in your throat. The real tale  of the unlikely ascendance  of the debate team at Wiley College, a small all-black institution in Marshall, Tex., in 1935, follows the template of countless sports movies. Perseverance and teamwork lead to untarnished glory.In its tone, though not in its content, "The Great Debaters" is the sequel to Mr. Washington's 2002 directorial debut, "Antwone Fisher," in which he played a Navy psychiatrist whose tough love helps save a broken soul. Here he portrays the noted poet, social activist and educator Melvin B. Tolson, who coached the Wiley College team. Righteous, autocratic and fearless, Mr. Washington's Tolson is a screen descendant of the stern East London schoolteacher played by Sidney Poitier 40 years ago in "To Sir, With Love." If Mr. Washington's two films are considerably richer in content than that civil rights-era weepie, at heart they are no less sentimental.Tolson is not only a ferocious coach but also a political firebrand (there are mutterings about his being a Communist) who runs afoul of the local sheriff (John Heard) for his organizing of the mixed-race Southern Tenant Farmers  Union. But whether Tolson is teaching or organizing, Mr. Washington imbues him with the authority of a persuasive orator and a moral Rock of Gibraltar."The Great Debaters" is aware that debating, an activity synonymous with nerdiness, needs a shot of adrenaline to be sexy to a mass audience. Early in the movie Tolson barks with the ferocity of a Marine Corps drill instructor, "Debate is a blood sport." As the team starts winning, his severity never diminishes. The debates themselves are swiftly edited compendiums of best-of moments.The four teammates handpicked by Tolson are Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a handsome,  clean-cut youth with a lurking bad-boy streak; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a dutiful eager beaver whose family pressures him to drop out when Tolson's radical political organizing comes to light; Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), a strait-laced aspiring lawyer and soft-edged proto-feminist; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a preacher's son whose father (Forest Whitaker) keeps him on a tight leash.Despite his name, the actor playing James Jr. is unrelated to either Mr. Washington or to Forest Whitaker. It is worth noting that the senior Farmer was the first African-American in Texas to earn a doctorate. His son, a leader of the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and '60s, founded the Congress of Racial Equality.This being Hollywood, a soupçon of romance is required. The movie dawdles only as long as necessary on the pudgy, cow-eyed young James's hopeless infatuation with Samantha, who becomes romantically involved with Henry."The Great Debaters" doesn't shy away from showing the humiliation and persecution of blacks in the Jim Crow South. When James Farmer Sr., accompanied by his family, accidentally runs over a pig, his humiliation at the hands of the owner and his redneck buddies makes your stomach turn.Later, Tolson, driving home from a debate with his students, comes upon a lynching. The flashes of the hideous atrocity sear your mind, and when the mob, still riled with blood lust, chases the car, your heart is in your throat. Afterward, Henry's shame and stifled fury drive him to a self-destructive spree.Robert Eisele's screenplay imagines a smooth historical arc. The characters' reactions to these events, it implies, sow the seeds of the civil-rights movement, which is also foreshadowed in the debates, whose topics too conveniently address civil-rights issues. Strangely, the Wiley College team always argues the progressive view. Its initial push to break the color barrier in college debating by competing with a white college in Oklahoma is too neatly paralleled by the debate topic: whether blacks should be allowed to attend state universities. A more intellectually subtle, less manipulative movie would have had the Wiley team arguing at least once against African-American interests.Even though the film makes it clear that the team's speeches are prepared in advance by Tolson, the literary and historical references blithely tossed around by the team members show astounding erudition, and their speaking voices carry only the tiniest hint of an East Texas twang.For dramatic purposes the setting of the climactic debate has been changed in the movie to Harvard from the University of Southern California, where it actually took place. Again the issue is too neatly selected: nonviolent civil disobedience versus the rule of law.The wonder is that "The Great Debaters" transcends its own simplifying  and manipulative ploys; it radiates nobility of spirit."The Great Debaters"  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language.THE GREAT DEBATERSOpens nationwide on Tuesday. Directed by Denzel Washington; written by Robert Eisele, based on a story by Mr. Eisele and Jeffrey Porro; director of photography, Philippe Rousselot; edited by Hughes Winborne; music by James Newton Howard and Peter Golub; production designer, David J. Bomba; produced by Todd Black, Kate Forte, Oprah Winfrey and Joe Roth; released by the Weinstein Company and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.WITH: Denzel Washington (Melvin B.

Accordingly, producers seem to believe that if a show has not opened somewhere in the vicinity of 42nd Street, it hasn't really opened at all.Once upon a time a cheeky musical parody like "Xanadu" would have splashed down at a funky theater down in the Village, a grotty place where the show's giddy silliness could be enhanced by the imbibing of a cocktail or two. Instead it set up shop at the Helen Hayes Theater, where it fights for the tourist trade alongside "Spamalot" and "Les Misérables."But today's Broadway-or-bust mentality cannot obscure the prevailing fact that much of the most interesting and enterprising theater in New York starts Off Broadway, even if it doesn't necessarily stay there. I decided to confine my best-of list this year to productions that took place away from the Great White Way. Here they are, in alphabetical order:'AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY' Yes, I know it's on Broadway now, but I first encountered Tracy Letts's scorching family saga at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago. That terrific production has been brought to New York with just a couple of minor cast changes. Under Anna D. Shapiro's incisive direction, the Steppenwolf's brilliant actors bring a captivating cohesion to Mr. Letts's savage black comedy about an Oklahoma clan's disintegration.CITY CENTER ENCORES! This venerable concert series often seemed to be treading water in recent seasons, if not scraping the bottom of the forgotten-musical barrel. But this season the series sprang back to fine form with terrific productions that showcased the breadth and depth of the city's musical talent. Irving Berlin and Moss Hart's "Face the Music" was a bubbly goof; "Stairway to Paradise" was a deliriously enjoyable nouveau revue that gave Kristin Chenoweth her best material in years; and "Follies" was simply as good as it gets. The series also inaugurated its first foray into the summer with a solid revival of "Gypsy" that had the whole town talking. (Well, the part of the town that talks about Broadway musicals anyway.)BARBARA COOK AND THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The Golden Age of the Broadway musical seems to be born anew every time Barbara Cook steps onstage to sing. In November this American treasure celebrated her 80th birthday with a pair of concerts at the Philharmonic that found her in typically radiant spirits and heavenly voice. A reprise arrives at the Philharmonic on Jan. 8.'DIVIDING THE ESTATE' Horton Foote's comedy about a Texas family squabbling over a diminishing financial legacy was first staged almost two decades ago, so why does it feel ripped from today's headlines? Mr. Foote's compassionate but stinging picture of an American family sniping as the walls of its cozy, insular world collapse provided a cogent comment on a cultural moment of general bankruptcy.'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's moving, oblique play about lives shattered by the Iraq war received a first-rate production from Lincoln Center Theater, with Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher delivering performances of nuance and simmering feeling. Mr. Shinn remains one of the country's most gifted young playwrights, notable for his quiet humanism and a wonderfully delicate ear for dialogue that leaves much unsaid but little unknown.'GONE MISSING' This long-running revue from the downtown troupe Civilians was a consumers' guide to losing, performed with brio and dry charm by a great cast. Smart, brisk and funny, it was the exception proving the rule that it's virtually impossible to win attention — or  audiences — in the commercial Off Broadway sphere these days. You can still catch it at the Barrow Street Theater, through Jan. 6.'IN THE HEIGHTS' AND 'PASSING STRANGE' The often-lamented death of the Off Broadway musical was both belied and, in a way, confirmed this year by a pair of shows that introduced exciting new musical voices — and vibrant performers — to the theater. Lin-Manuel Miranda's affectionate tribute to his upbringing in Washington Heights had humor, spice and a good heart, as well as a bubbly Latin-inflected score. At the Public Theater the singer-songwriter Stew set the quirky story of his sentimental education to a groovy score that mixed driving rock with moody R&B. The bad news: Neither truly thrived Off Broadway. The good: They'll both get a second shot at breaking through to wider audiences when they move to Broadway this spring. Anyone interested in figuring out where the musical may next be headed will want to check them out.THE METROPOLITAN OPERA Quite a few of the finest performances I saw this year came courtesy of the newly re-energized Met, where a heightened emphasis on theatrical values is under way. A partial list of the year's highlights, for me, would have to include Karita Mattila's moving "Jenufa," Renée Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky as the fate-bedeviled couple in "Eugene Onegin," and Susan Graham's transfixing turn in "Iphigénie en Tauride."'OHIO STATE MURDERS' An inspiring reminder that the country's great playwrights are not all white males, living or dead. Adrienne Kennedy's semi-autobiographical play was essentially a spellbinding monologue about a college student encountering the baleful force of racism. Theater for a New Audience, which produced the play as part of a season devoted to exploring the connections among America, Africa and Europe, remains the most sophisticated purveyor of revivals in the major Off Broadway leagues.'PETER AND JERRY' The ageless Edward Albee wrote a short, sharp and  shocking prequel to his landmark one-acter "The Zoo Story." Called "Homelife," it traces the emotional fissures in the marriage of the sedate fellow provoked to violence in that 1958 classic. Performed together as a single play under the title "Peter and Jerry," the plays gave Bill Pullman a chance to prove anew that he's the best reactor in the acting world.
