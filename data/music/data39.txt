March 1.JWL B. of the Florida hip-hop duo Yo Majesty was not satisfied with her tight-collared, mostly male audience at a New York club last fall. So she nonchalantly peeled off her oversized white T-shirt and black sports bra and performed the next several songs topless, bounding about the stage with the ease of a shirtless male rapper. The audience lit up and finally proceeded to, as the Yo Majesty song "Club Action" commands, get their behinds "on the floor."And that is how a lesbian rap group from Florida got an uptight Manhattan crowd to relax a little."I got stretch marks, and I'm fat, and I'm wildin,' " Jwl B., whose real name is Jewel Baynham, said in a phone interview. "But your boy 50 Cent does his show with his shirt off. Why can't I? God made me who I am, and I'm comfortable in it. I want people to know you don't have to look glamorous to be an inspiration."It's a lackluster time for mainstream female rappers, with M.C.'s like Foxy Brown and Remy Ma making more headlines for jail stints than for their music. Lil' Kim hasn't gone platinum since 2003, Eve's comeback album has been delayed several times, and Missy Elliott's first record in three years isn't due until late spring. Fergie, with her singsong chants about her feminine wiles, is the closest thing to a female rap superstar these days. But in the wake of the critical favorite M.I.A., a new crop of young, multicultural, female hip-hop acts is causing a stir on the Internet and in indie-label conference rooms.There's Kid Sister, a cheeky, charismatic rapper from Chicago who recently released a video featuring Kanye West; Amanda Blank, a nasty-mouthed M.C. from Philadelphia who is associated with the hipster male hip-hopper Spank Rock; and Santogold, a new-wavey singer and dub-style rapper from Brooklyn who toured with Bjork last fall. Though their styles vary from agile wordplay to club-ready choruses, what unites them is their fresh, left-of-center enthusiasm; their bold attitudes; and an expansive approach to female sexuality."There is a reason why these artists are having so much early traction online," said Josh Deutsch, chief executive of Downtown Records, which will release albums by Amanda Blank and Santogold this spring. "And it's because they have such strong voices and strong points of view. There's nothing remotely manufactured about them."Yo Majesty's roots go back six years, when Ms. Baynham met LaShunda Flowers, who is known as Shunda K., a track star turned rapper, at a gay club in Tampa, Fla. (A third member, Shon Burt, quit recently.) The group's early songs were "real gay music," Ms. Flowers said.Yo Majesty broke up for a few years, during which Ms. Flowers renounced her homosexuality, found God, married a male Christian missionary, got divorced then reclaimed her lesbian identity. Upon reuniting, the rappers began building a following through MySpace. That led to a recording contract with Domino Records, which will release their debut album this year.Yo Majesty's party-rap proudly celebrates everything below the waist, but the duo also grapples with growing up Christian and gay. "At the end of every show," Ms. Flowers said, "whatever we do, we ask people, 'Do you know who the Lord is?' "The only religion in Amanda Blank's music is the kind she is losing. Ms. Blank, whose real name is Amanda Mallory, mimics the pornographic lyrics of Southern rappers like Trina and Khia, but she ramps up the gross-out factor to the point of nigh-absurdity. Her persona is a mix of seediness and street-toughness, which is on display in "Loose," a recent video by Spank Rock. As several naked, tattooed women writhe all over him, Ms. Blank sits on a toilet, threatening to fight rappers who try to steal her style and making highly unprintable claims about her sexual prowess.Unlike Yo Majesty and Amanda Blank, Kid Sister spurns sexual frankness in favor of innuendo. Born Melisa Young on the South Side of Chicago, she dismisses unsuitable suitors while strutting her postmodern stuff. "We could be hugged up like hippies on a tree trunk," she teases in her verse in Chromeo's "Tenderoni," while "Telephone" reprimands a guy for calling too much. In the video for her single "Pro Nails," backup dancers sit in pedicure chairs, lip-synching the chorus: "Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'."The video underscores Ms. Young's populist, all-ages aspirations. "It's music made by a girl who shops at Target, made for girls who shop at Target," Ms. Young said. "Or girls who work at LensCrafters or Ace Hardware or are sorority sisters or debutantes."Angel Laws, editor of the celebrity news Web site Concreteloop.com and an early champion of Kid Sister, said: "I think she stands out. She's a party rapper, bringing back the '80s style with the club-hop." (Kid Sister's debut album, "KoKo B. Ware," is due from Fool's Gold Records this summer.)But the artist with the loudest buzz is Santogold, who has already been called  the next big thing in many articles. Born Santi White, she parlayed a college internship at Ruffhouse Records into a job as an A&R scout for Sony. After she was executive producer and wrote most of the songs on an album for the R&B singer Res, she left and eventually formed her own punk band, Stiffed.In 2006 Ms. White, who now lives in Brooklyn, began writing her own songs; "Creator" and "LES Artists" confess to feelings of alienation, but she also revels in her individuality. Singing in a haunting, sensual wail, or toasting in the style of dub M.C.'s, she adds a layer of softness to an unusual mix of synthesizers, dancehall rhythms and percolating new wave."She appeals very broadly," said Martin Heath, the founder of Lizard King Records, which signed Stiffed and is jointly releasing Santogold's debut album with Downtown. "She's not cliché one way or the other. She's not playing on the foxy thing."Ms. White said she admires other female artists who try to defy stereotypes. "You get these images of women in sexy clothes, walking around in, like, panties," she said. "Even Beyoncé  —  that's what it is to be a woman and make music. But now there are all these other women doing cool, interesting things, wearing styles they came up with, and it's not about being naked."Since the time seems ripe for underground, unquantifiable female M.C.'s, the Lady Tigra is hoping that pioneers will have a place too. She was half of the '80s duo L'Trimm, which scored a poppy Miami bass hit with "Cars that Go Boom" in 1988.After spending the last two decades getting a creative writing degree, managing Manhattan clubs and writing and singing the theme song for the frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry ("Sorry Ice Cream"), she's preparing for a comeback. Her first solo album, "Please Mr. Boom Box," released by High Score Records, is available through major digital retailers.Tigra's aesthetic hasn't changed much since the '80s. She raps in the same honeyed, high-pitched tone, and there are beefy low-end clicks, handclaps and electro synthesizers, all hallmarks of classic Miami bass music. But contrary to much music of that genre, there is little overt sex; she prefers coy comebacks.The Lady Tigra, whose real name is Rachel de Rougemont, said she hopes that girls will realize that artists like Fergie and Gwen Stefani were inspired by semi-forgotten female forebears like "L'Trimm and J. J. Fad and M.C. Lyte and get into that.""Before, you'd really have to come with it to be considered an M.C.," she added. "And now women get — if not equal — way more respect and recognition for what they do."ComedyPEEKSKILL Paramount Center for the Arts Sinbad. Feb. 2 at 8 p.m. $30 to $55.

This week Alicia Keys, below, stays atop the Billboard chart with "As I Am" (J), but the number of copies that CD sold is barely above the historic low for a No. 1 album. Nielsen SoundScan reported that 61,000 copies of the album sold last week; the least number of weekly sales for No. 1 is 60,000, set by the "Dreamgirls" soundtrack a year ago. (The numbers are rounded.) This week the "Juno" soundtrack (Rhino) is at No. 2 with 58,000, Mary J. Blige's "Growing Pains" (Geffen) is No. 3 with 52,000, and Radiohead's "In Rainbows" (ATO) is next with 46,000. The R&B singer Raheem DeVaughn opens at No. 5 with 45,000 sales of "Love Behind the Melody" (J) and John Legend's new "Live From Philadelphia," available only through Target, reached No. 7 with 33,000.There was no dancing at one of the best performances of Jerome Robbins's "Goldberg Variations" that I have attended. I was late for the matinee. And as the score welled out into the First Ring lobby of the New York State Theater, I sat in the early afternoon sunshine and simply listened to the music in the company of the lobby's giant Nadelman ladies. It was unexpected magic and perhaps forgivable considering George Balanchine's famous observation that if you didn't like the ballet you could just close your eyes and hear the music.The clarity and richness of Cameron Grant's playing of this Bach score brought back memories of that afternoon on Friday night at the New York State Theater, when the New York City Ballet presented "Goldberg Variations" as part of its "Spirit of Discovery" program. (Oh, those titles, and whatever happened to Programs A, B and C?) But the ballet itself still feels problematic.Robbins said he took on the score as a challenge, and "Goldberg" looks like an exercise at times. It is certainly monumental, a thing of stage-filling, unceasingly changing ranks and patterns accented with cannily timed and placed entrances, exits and sudden unnoticeable shifts of dancers.Its ambition is dazzling as it works its way through Bach's escalating variations on the theme. And yet there are a few too many fairly naked quotations from Robbins's "Dances at a Gathering," choreographed in 1969, two years before "Goldberg." The costume changes become monotonous, and the ballet suffers in general from a somewhat dogged, beat-for-beat quality.There are pockets of exquisite choreography tucked into the layers of artifice, most notably a series of pas de deux danced here by Rachel Rutherford and Jared Angle, Maria Kowroski and Philip Neal, and Wendy Whelan and Benjamin Millepied. The Rutherford-Angle  duet was a beauty, its strange supported doublings over and openings out performed with dreaming voluptuousness by Ms. Rutherford. Here Robbins works against the music's demanding beat, and the effect is exhilarating.Ms. Whelan brought a distinctively easy authority to her pas de deux, her feet never quite seeming to touch the floor as Mr. Millepied lowered her from lifts. And Mr. Neal's odd, slightly teasing solo, in which Robbins seems almost to be caricaturing the ballet at moments, was a special pleasure, in part because it offered the chance to watch this fine performer undistracted.The performances by Ms. Rutherford, Mr. Angle, Ms. Whelan and Mr. Millepied were all role debuts. There was also a debut by Abi Stafford, unflatteringly costumed but also generally undistinguished in Part 1, performed with Tyler Angle, Adam Hendrickson, Megan Fairchild, Stephen Hanna and Andrew Veyette. And Kaitlyn Gilliland captured the lyrical possibilities of the ballet's period manners in the "Theme" section, danced with Jason Fowler.Ashley Bouder and Gonzalo Garcia, both new in Balanchine's "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux," tended to look smaller than the music but sailed through the ballet's technical demands with enchanting humor and daring, in Ms. Bouder's case, and with a velvety finish in Mr. Garcia's turns and buttery stops.Fayçal Karoui, the evening's conductor, inspired the orchestra to newly teasing heights in parts of Hershy Kay's down-home score for Balanchine's "Western Symphony." Ms. Stafford, in yet another new role, was too much of a soubrette in the opening Allegro section, in which she was partnered by Nilas Martins as an amusingly laid-back cowpoke. The lead cast also included Sterling Hyltin and Albert Evans leading the Adagio and Teresa Reichlen and Damian Woetzel the Rondo. The witty Ms. Hyltin and the dazzling and delicious Mr. Woetzel stole the show.As conditions in his homeland, Rwanda, went from tense to murderously chaotic in the mid-1990s, Stan Knight clung to his music.Before the wave of violence that erupted in 1994 — and even, for a time, after it — Mr. Knight, then a teenager, earned money as a D.J. at clubs and parties in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, spinning records by American hip-hop and R & B artists."It makes you feel good knowing that without the music, people would have been thinking about the situation they were in," said Mr. Knight, now 27. "They could escape all their problems for that moment."But it was hard to escape the problems for long. Though he evaded the genocide that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Tutsis in the span of a few weeks, Mr. Knight could not avoid the disorder and the fear that followed. The streets teemed with thugs, preying on impressionable youths and urging them to join their ranks. Men armed with AK-47s ransacked his home, terrorizing his family in ways he is reluctant to talk about. He knew he had to leave.For five years he was adrift, he said, a refugee in central Africa: to Zaire (now called Congo), to Uganda, to Kenya, back to Congo. Finally, he and a friend sneaked onto a cargo ship, concealing themselves in a container that held clothing and electronics. They crept out only to take peanuts, bread and water from the ship's galley when the ship stopped in ports, which it did several times. Each time, they wondered where they were and whether it was time to get off. His friend left the ship sooner; Mr. Knight does not know what became of him.When the ship arrived in New Jersey — he still does not know which city it was —  in February 1999, he emerged from his metal box malnourished and dazed after three months of hiding.A dockworker found Mr. Knight, who had learned English as a child, and asked him if he was part of the crew. Mr. Knight told him the truth, though he was afraid he would be deported. The man instead took him to a Manhattan church. When he told the people there his story, they took him to Covenant House, where he was given food, and a place to bathe and sleep.Workers there helped him apply for political asylum, Section 8 housing and other assistance. He worked in retail and continued to pursue his interest in music.When his Section 8 housing came through in 2004, Mr. Knight left Covenant House. His new home is a tiny apartment with a kitchenette in a town house on the Upper West Side. He has his own bathroom, though he has to walk down the hall to get to it.He continued to support himself with retail jobs until a seasonal position at J. Crew ended in 2006. Mr. Knight was hopeful he would find work before he went through his savings, but he did not. He was unemployed for about a year. "It was a struggle to find a job that would work out," he said. "It was a horrible time."He received $63 a month in food stamps; when he ran out, he did not eat. He sat in the dark because he could not pay his electricity bill. His rent was $80 a month, but he could not pay it.He walked as far as he could in every direction from his apartment, stopping at stores to seek work."I was this close to losing the apartment," he said, holding up his hand with his thumb near his index finger.The Coalition for the Homeless referred him to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. Last February, the federation, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, drew $800 from the fund to cover 10 months of back rent. For the balance, he was able to scrape together $80, and public assistance paid $80."I was lucky," he said, adding how thankful he was for the grant. Soon after, he found work as a customer service representative in the men's department at Filene's Basement, where he works today."I'm trying to reach my goal to be somebody," he said. Notebooks stacked by his bed are full of lyrics, ideas and dreams."I get inspiration from everywhere — just the daily struggles, people trying to get by — I take all that and just put it into music," Mr. Knight said.Recently, he recorded a few tracks and has put them on his MySpace page. Last week, he started college courses in marketing at Borough of Manhattan Community College."Every day, it is getting a little better," he said. "I feel lucky I am alive, that I am breathing."POPFull reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.NICOLE ATKINS For almost two years now Ms. Atkins, above, has been on the brink of fame, which can sometimes seem a fate worse than failure. First there was a profile in Rolling Stone that tagged her as an "artist to watch." Then came an American Express commercial — Martin  Scorsese treatment all the way — which would have been perfect timing had her debut album come out on time. Instead fans waited. And waited. When "Neptune City" (Columbia) was finally released in late October, it received positive reviews but sold poorly, and all that buzz seemed to pack up and head somewhere else.That's a shame. Ms. Atkins, 29, is one of the most talented singer-songwriters to emerge in New York in years, with songs that have anxious undercurrents despite their romantic, cinematic sweep — "pop noir," she calls it. She named her album after her hometown on the Jersey Shore, and in the title song, over a slow, murky beat that seems to sway like the sea, she sings of being stuck in a surreal state somewhere between being unable to leave home and being unable to return. "Maybe if I paid attention, I could learn to love the landscape I was born to," she sings.One wailing crescendo is all it takes to make you realize that Ms. Atkins is a woman with no small amount of will power. And while she didn't become the next Patti Smith overnight, she has persevered through all the fly-by-night hype and release-date postponements with gig after gig. On Friday she plays her long-delayed headlining date at the Bowery Ballroom, which for local acts can be either the stepping stone to something bigger or simply a career peak. Which will it be for Nicole Atkins? (At 8 p.m., with Craig Wedren and the Parlor Mob; 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 212-533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.) BEN SISARIO CHROMEO (Saturday and Monday) You take the '80s train to Pet Shop Boys and Cameo — not too fast, not too racy, not too challenging — in the midtempo electronic head-nodders by this Montreal duo. With the Chicago indie rapper Kid Sister. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)JUDY COLLINS (Friday and Saturday, and Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. (Through March 1.) At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125 and $175. (Stephen Holden)CORNELIUS (Saturday) Keigo Oyamada, a Japanese musician who records as Cornelius (he took his name after Roddy McDowall's character in "Planet of the Apes"), is a witty if cold conceptualist, toying with minimal electronics and off-kilter rhythms that sound like the stimuli of some psychological lab experiment. His "Sensuous Synchronized Show" incorporates kaleidoscopic visuals. With the Benevento-Russo Duo, whose meanderings on keyboard and drums begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario)TOUMANI DIABATÉ'S SYMMETRIC ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Mr. Diabaté, the Malian kora master, plays regular gigs back home with his big band, mixing ancient songs with salsa-infused funk and lyrical improvisations on the kora, a harplike instrument that allows him to play three parts at once. With Fernando Otero. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25.

(Sisario) ★ GOSPEL CARAVAN (Friday) The performers at this World Music Institute concert make a good case for gospel music's being truly timeless. In one form or other the Blind Boys of Alabama have been active since 1939, and the Dixie Hummingbirds since 1928, harmonizing with a passionate intensity that directly influenced R&B and rock music. Also on the bill are Chuck Campbell, who plays "sacred steel" lap guitar; and the McIntosh County Shouters, from the Georgia coast, who pound out rhythms with a broom as they sing. At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, worldmusicinstitute.org; $30 to $60. (Sisario)LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Saturday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to Zulu singing, is in the midst of transition. On Wednesday  Joseph Shabalala, its 65-year-old founder, made a vague statement about retiring, saying that he would hand the reins over to his son Thamsanqa. No date was given, but this may very well be Mr. Shabalala's last tour.  At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $41.50. (Sisario)JEFFREY LEWIS AND THE JITTERS (Wednesday) A veteran of the scruffy "antifolk" circuit that produced the Moldy Peaches and Regina Spektor, Jeffrey Lewis has a severe case of logorrhea that is not confined to his music. He is a gifted cartoonist and combines his monologues on everyday life and earnest bohemianism with storyboard history lessons. (Topics have included Karl Marx and the British post-punk stalwarts the Fall.)  At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Friday and Saturday) Lincoln Center's flagship pop series is dedicated to crossing genres and experimenting with the idea of a modern American canon, though this weekend's concerts are a little on the conventional side. On Friday Rob Fisher, the former musical director of City Center's "Encores!," leads a Bernstein concert. Saturday is Broadway standards, with Kelli O'Hara, who will star in "South Pacific" at the Lincoln Center Theater this spring. Friday at 8:30 p.m., Saturday at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario)MARILYN MANSON (Tuesday and Wednesday) The world's least shocking shock-rocker is back on tour. One bit of good news: he has been reunited with his former guitarist, Twiggy Ramirez, which might bring back some of the spark of songs like "The Beautiful People." With Ours. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $64.50. (Sisario)HUGH MASEKELA (Sunday) This South African fluegelhorn player has more to offer than "Grazing in the Grass," his international hit from 1968. For decades he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25. (Jon Pareles) ★ NEUROSIS, MASTODON (Friday) The good thing about experimental heavy-metal groups is that no matter how out there they get, they stick to the rudiments of riffing, screaming and pummeling. For this first of two shows at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple in Fort Greene, Neurosis, a longtime "post-metal" band from Oakland, Calif., teams with Mastodon, an Atlanta group so brainy that it wrote a concept album based on "Moby-Dick." At 8 p.m., 317 Claremont Avenue, at Lafayette Street, brooklynmasonictemple.com; sold out. (Sisario)NEW YORK GUITAR FESTIVAL (Sunday and Thursday) It's marathon time, with a two-part Brazilian event on Sunday at the 92nd Street Y programmed by Sérgio and Odair Assad.

Information: newyorkguitarfestival.org. (Sisario) ★ JOANNA NEWSOM (Thursday) The fairy queen of the freak-folk movement, Ms. Newsom uses a harp and her froggish little voice to spin elaborate, beguiling fantasies. On Thursday, in the first of two concerts, she is accompanied by none other than the Brooklyn Philharmonic in a performance of her brilliantly expansive 2006 album, "Ys," which was orchestrated by Van Dyke Parks. She also performs a set with her band. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $25 to $55.

(Pareles)SPECTRUM (Friday, Saturday and Monday) In the 1980s Peter Kember, a k a Sonic Boom, was a member of Spacemen 3, an influential British band that found a twilight zone between garage-rock and the druggy minimalism of the Velvet Underground. On his own, with Spectrum and other projects, he has perfected a technique of disassembling pop songs into ever purer forms of drone, though he's still full of surprises: his new album is a collaboration with the storied Memphis producer Jim Dickinson (the Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin). Friday at 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15.

At 9 and 11:30 p.m., 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $65 cover; $30 minimum; dinner is required at 9. (Holden)SUPER FURRY ANIMALS (Friday) This Welsh band plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys' melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country-folk. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Sisario)THE TEENAGERS (Wednesday and Thursday) All pop odes to Hollywood sexpots should be like this French-British band's "Scarlett Johansson," a spunky new-wave confession in broken English that is both safely ironic and genuinely creepy: "I'll sell my mum to be lost with you/Lost in Tokyo or anywhere else." Wednesday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

I Did It Again." At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $29.50 to $39.50. (Sisario) ★ VAMPIRE WEEKEND (Tuesday and Wednesday) A hybrid of the Strokes and Paul Simon's "Graceland," the songs by this buzz band of recent Columbia University graduates are lean, smart indie rock blended with the sunny guitars of Afro-pop. If that sounds weird, get used to it: it's the newest and most promising trend in an indie world running dangerously short on new ideas. The band plays two sold-out shows at the Bowery Ballroom in celebration of its excellent debut album. Beat the Devil and Sam Rosen open the show on Tuesday; Plastic Little and Aa on Wednesday. At 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com.
