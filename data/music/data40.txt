"I think it's almost on the day, 10 years ago, that I was here with my first album," said Robyn, and there was a cheer. "But this is the first time that I have ever played live in the United States of America." And then came an ovation so loud and so long that she seemed faintly embarrassed by it.Her first album was "Robyn Is Here," and it took her from her native Sweden to charts and radio stations all over the world. Two of her collaborators were the Swedish producers Denniz Pop and Max Martin, pop scientists who had already worked with Ace of Base and would go on to work with Britney Spears, among many others. Back then Robyn's songs seemed like shiny links in a long chain of cheerful Swedish hits.But at the Highline Ballroom on Tuesday night, she was greeted as a conquering hero. And she performed like one too. Facing an audience of rabid cult fans, she sang a short set of fierce, bittersweet songs, pausing every few minutes to accept applause and, at one point, an oversize Valentine's Day card. It said, "See this smile on my face?" Was she blushing?Robyn never stopped being a star in Sweden. But by 2002, when she released an R&B-inflected album called "Don't Stop the Music," she was getting restless. (She now calls that CD "a big compromise.") So she reinvented herself, embracing spikier tracks and pricklier lyrics. The result was "Robyn," a delectable electronic pop album from 2005, which includes a collaboration with the acerbic Swedish electronic duo the Knife. That album, which reached these shores mainly through the Internet, won her new American fans, including many from the worlds of indie rock and dance music. Three years later a reworked version of the album is scheduled for an American release, April 15 on Cherrytree Records, an imprint of Interscope.And so Tuesday's concert  —  a showcase for a 28-year-old pop veteran who has already conquered America once  — felt like an introduction. Accompanied by two drummers and a stack of electronics, Robyn showed off her strong voice and her smart way of using it: she often keeps her vocal range small, the better to focus on rhythmic precision. During "Handle Me," she wasn't so much singing as riding the beat, almost smiling as she sneered, "You're a selfish, narcissistic, psycho-freaking, bootlicking Nazi creep/And you can't handle me." (Advance copies of the Cherrytree version of "Robyn" censor the word "Nazi." Are Americans really that delicate?)Robyn's status as a cult favorite in America reflects the slightly scrambled relationship between mainstream pop and underground music. Like Annie (who's Norwegian) before her, Robyn has been adopted by listeners who traditionally take pride in disdaining commercial fluff. (Being foreign probably helps; from Cassie to Aly & A J, American electro-pop stars don't seem to have the same cachet.) And she arrives in America at a time when quirky electronic tracks are firmly ensconced in the musical mainstream. For example, the recent album from Ms. Spears, "Blackout" (Jive/Zomba), included a collaboration with the Los Angeles indie-electronic duo Freescha —  and, as it happens, backing vocals from Robyn herself.Tuesday's set included two versions of one of her best songs, "Be Mine": the sharp new-wave album version and a piano-ballad remake that sounded downright (and pleasingly) Cyndi Lauperish. And near the end there was a sparse, staccato introduction and then a familiar couplet: "Always been told that I've got too much pride/Too independent to have you by my side."Near the back of the crowd, one fan turned to her friend. "This is a cover," she said. And maybe she was right, or half-right. The song in question was a smartly reworked version of "Show Me Love," a decade-old international hit by a teenage pop star who also happens to be called Robyn. Same name. Same person. Different career.K. D. LANG"Watershed" (Nonesuch)The handsome gloss of strings on much of "Watershed" can only do so much to brighten the mood. K. D. Lang, who produced the album herself, has clearly spent some recent time answering the call of melancholy. This is her first collection of new material in eight years, and its atmosphere, luxurious and doleful, reflects a state of heavy contemplation.Ms. Lang, 46, has walked this road before. Heartache is her natural habitat, as it was for one of her early heroines, Patsy Cline. But the songs on "Watershed" aren't torch-lit with longing, as they once might have been. Instead they project the voice of experience.Her own voice, a proven instrument of bigness and incandescence, rarely stretches beyond a thoughtful murmur here. At times this restraint lends the songs an artfully unfinished feeling. Even the outright love songs manage to hold something back, qualifying themselves. "I will drive you crazy, baby," she sings. "Once in a while."Ms. Lang wrote most of this material with some of the same collaborators who back her in the studio, notably the bassist David Piltch, the guitarist Ben Mink and the pianist and organist Teddy Borowiecki, who also wrote the string arrangements. Accordingly, the music feels as personal as the lyrics. The frame of reference effortlessly spans country, bossa nova and a few different shades of vintage pop, with only one distracting allusion (the late-era Beatles crescendo that swells up within "Close Your Eyes").Of course the album's easeful sound conflicts with an uneasy spirit. On one track especially, "Shadow and the Frame," Ms. Lang allows herself a painful self-assessment. "The promise of my prime/Fading on the vine," she sings.A moment later, in a half-whisper:And so illusive This life we liveSad and dullBut beautifulIn some ways "Watershed" feels like the byproduct of that realization, teetering between the prosaic and the profound. Remarkably Ms. Lang approaches it with an open heart and a scrupulous absence of ornament. NATE CHINEN STEP UP 2 THE STREETSOriginal Motion Picture Soundtrack (Atlantic)The song is called "Low," and it's a smash: the No. 1 song in the country for six weeks running. But listen closely, and you might notice that it has a split personality. In the verses the rising rapper Flo Rida delivers an agile ode to an agile woman who dances for a living: "So sexual/She was flexible/Professional." But in the chorus, T-Pain seems to be singing the praises of an amateur. The woman of his dreams is wearing "baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps," an ensemble that hardly seems calculated to maximize gratuities.Happily, these two agree on one thing: the woman in question gets low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low. (No footnotes are provided, but students of the subject may recall the influential work of Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Twins.) Add brisk electronic production by DJ Montay, including a sharp backbeat, and the result is a perfectly aerodynamic dance track that sounds (despite the lyrics) more athletic than lecherous.Now "Low" is getting an album release, on the soundtrack to "Step Up 2 the Streets," the sequel to the 2006 dance-battle movie "Step Up." And listeners who impulsively (or foolishly?) fork over their $15 for the CD might be pleasantly surprised by what they find. This is a smartly assembled compilation, designed to intrigue dance-pop obsessives. There are two new Missy Elliott tracks, along with recent hits from Trey Songz, Plies and Cupid, whose "369" was a hit in at least one iPod.Scrutinize the credits, and you'll also find two new productions from Danja, who helped create many of Timbaland's recent hits: Bayje's "Impossible" and KC's "Say Cheese" both confirm suspicions that Danja is perfecting his own electro-goth variant of R&B. And then there's Cassie, a 2006 success story (remember "Me & U," or the toothsome self-titled debut album that contained it?) who may finally be returning to the radio. In "Is It You," she sings a breezy pop song over four crunchy chords; let's hope she has a dozen more just like it. KELEFA SANNEH NADA SURF"Lucky" (Barsuk)"Beautiful beat lift me up from distress," Matthew Caws sings on "Lucky," the fifth album by the Brooklyn band Nada Surf. He means it, although Nada Surf relies less on rhythm than on yearning melodies and polished harmonies to carry songs from despair toward consolation.Nada Surf smirked through its lone hit, "Popular," in 1996, but since then angst has infiltrated its music. Nothing sounds facile anymore. The songs — by Mr. Caws, Daniel Lorca on bass and Ira Elliot on drums — are clear-cut verse-chorus-verse, by way of the Beach Boys, the Beatles, the Byrds and latter-day folk-rock and power pop, from R.E.M. to Weezer to Death Cab for Cutie (which lends two of its members to the album). While Nada Surf is only a trio, in the studio it stacks up guitars and vocals, multiplying Mr. Caws's thin voice into a dreamy or determined chorale.Most of the time he starts out mopey. "See These Bones" is sung by skeletons: "What you are now we were once/But just like we are you'll be dust." Yet minor-key fingerpicking leads to major chords, the beat gets stronger and vocal harmonies make the last choruses almost optimistic: "Look alive, see these bones."Robustly strummed songs, like "Here Goes Something" and "Whose Authority," hold bleak views of the state of the world. In the personal realm the singer stays wary of love, though grateful for it, in "Are You Lightning?" and "I Like What You Say," while in the seemingly upbeat "From Now On," jealousy spins him nearly out of control: "No good state lasts/What I get slow is how to bounce back." As the album ends, "The Film Did Not Go Round" unites love and death: "Everyone's gotta leave their love sometime/If not now, then at the end of your lifetime." But the music, a pristine ballad shared by Mr. Caws and Lianne Smith singing in close harmony, finds serenity.Nada Surf's two New York shows this week — Thursday at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, and Friday at the Bowery Ballroom — are sold out. JON PARELES CUONG VU"Vu-Tet" (ArtistShare)The trumpeter Cuong Vu is a counter-intuitive sort. Jazz formed him, but in his own bands he started moving away from its typical textures, rhythms and instrumentation about 10 years ago.The result was a kind of dreamy and detailed rock, with backbeats, drones, cathedral echoes and viscous, distorted bass sounds. He wrote some dramatic songs and created his own trumpet vocabulary for them: long tones, dirty squelches and occasionally the fast lines that young jazz trumpeters eat for breakfast. The music was pretty free, with gorgeous harmonies to frame it; it had something in common with Jon Hassell's ambient minimalism, and maybe more with Miles Davis's spacey electric music from the early 1970s.The music seemed as if it wanted an electric guitarist, and it got one on Mr. Vu's last album. That guitarist was Bill Frisell, who tends to dominate in other people's bands. But for Mr. Vu, adding guitar was too natural, too obvious; suddenly his group sounded a bit more ordinary, more within the known realm of jazz-rock.Now he's made just the right move. "Vu-Tet" (available at artistshare.com, along with copious documentation about its making) has no electric guitar; instead, alongside Stomu Takeishi on electric bass and the drummer Ted Poor, there's Chris Speed, the saxophonist and clarinetist. One of this record's most powerful moments is in a 10-minute track called "Solitary Confinement," in which Mr. Speed enters at the track's boiling point, over a roaring, almost death-metal bass and thudding drums. And he proceeds to play the clarinet, gracefully, in its delicate high register. Score one for counter-intuition.Listeners coming from jazz won't feel lost. Plenty of the genre's current obsessions are here: odd-meter rhythm patterns, slow soloing over fast rhythm (vice versa too), and a kind of bucolic lyricism that descends from Pat Metheny. But then the point of Mr. Vu's music, at its best, is just that: to make you feel lost in it. BEN RATLIFF COPLAND: PIANO VARIATIONS, PIANO SONATA, PIANO FANTASYRobert Weirich, pianist. Albany Records TROY 989; CD. IN general the concertgoing public may not think of Aaron Copland as a composer of piano music. Yet three of his most original, important and thorny compositions are works for that instrument: the Piano Variations (1930), the Piano Sonata (1939-41) and the Piano Fantasy (1955-57). It's inexplicable that these landmark scores are not repertory staples. So thanks go to the acclaimed pianist Robert Weirich, also a noted teacher, author and composer, who has recorded the three works here in brilliant, probing and austerely beautiful performances.Those who know only the Americana Copland may be shocked by the ascetic, unabashedly modern Piano Variations. It begins with a steely, slow, angular four-note motif, followed by a dissonant, loud and lingering chord. The pitches announce themselves, to quote Mr. Weirich's liner notes, "as if delivered on stone tablets from the mountaintop." Thus begins an exhilarating 13-minute exploration of the theme through a myriad of means: canon, inversion, augmentation, transposition and other techniques championed at the time by the composers of the Second Viennese School.The Piano Sonata was written after Copland had enjoyed great success with populist scores like "Billy the Kid." Yet despite moments of hymnal beauty and tart tonality, the sonata has a spare-textured and rigorous character. The three-movement structure is also unconventional, with slow outer movements framing a scherzo: perky, slightly jazzy music that keeps mischievously slipping out of its asymmetrical 5/8 meter.In the mid-'50s Copland appropriated the 12-tone technique for his Piano Fantasy, but on his own terms. The row, such as it is, has just 10 notes, and the piece has passages of lush yet fresh and acute tonal harmony. Mr. Weirich's gripping account of this volatile, ingenious 30-minute fantasy makes the question of how Copland fashioned its harmonic language seem beside the point. ANTHONY  TOMMASINIBACH: 'THE WELL-TEMPERED CLAVIER,' BOOK 1Andrew Rangell, pianist. Bridge 9246A/B; CD.ONE enviably difficult task for a music critic is selecting which discs to listen to from a towering pile of alluring CDs. I rarely race to my stereo to insert the latest recording of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (although I enjoy listening to it live), but I invariably rush to rip the packaging off the newest rendition of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations or "Well-Tempered Clavier."Andrew Rangell's idiosyncratic recording of the first book of "The Well- Tempered Clavier" doesn't disappoint. This pianist, whose career performing in public has been curtailed by focal dystonia, has instead focused his imaginative musicality and intellect on the recording studio. His free-spirited Bach is distinguished by its powerful drive and intensity and a remarkable articulation that illuminates contrapuntal intricacies with microscopic clarity.Mr. Rangell doesn't hesitate to employ the full dynamic possibilities and heft of a modern Steinway, producing a weighty sound sometimes more Beethovenian than Bachian. His playing captures every mood in the psychological spectrum, from giddy, almost manic excitement in the Preludes Nos. 3 and 5 to dark introspection in the Fugues Nos. 4 and 24 and quiet dignity in the Fugue No. 8.He also demonstrates vivid contrast of touch, from beautifully singing lines in the opening of the Prelude No. 9 to rapid-fire staccato in the Prelude No. 6. There is plenty of colorful virtuosity along the way, as in the kaleidoscopic Prelude No. 15.This is an interpretation full of unexpected quirks and dynamic contrasts. Mr. Rangell sometimes takes liberties with tempo and rubato, but his interpretive decisions, never in bad taste, make musical sense.A number of engrossing recordings of "The Well-Tempered Clavier" on piano have been released over the last decade, including Angela Hewitt's elegant reading. It's wonderful to be spoiled with so many choices. VIVIEN SCHWEITZER LISA BIELAWA: 'A Handful of World'Lisa Bielawa, vocalist; Carla Kihlstedt, violinist and vocalist; Jacqueline Leclair, English hornist; Cerddorion, conducted by Kristina Boerger. Tzadik 8039; CD.AS a singer in the Philip Glass Ensemble and a founder of the adventurous MATA Festival, Lisa Bielawa has become better known for promoting other composers' music than for her own. That imbalance has lately been redressed, thanks to high-profile commissions and a residency with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. And though she remains woefully underrepresented on disc, "A Handful of World" hints at the variety of her work.The unifying principle of this musically disparate collection is literary. Ms. Bielawa takes her texts from Kafka's meditations, the Book of Lamentations and Aeschylus' "Suppliant Maidens," and she responds to each with music that suggests a deeply personal and contemporary resonance for even the most ancient and mythical of them."Kafka Songs" (2003) is scored for a violinist who sings, a tall order given the rhythmic independence of the two lines and the fluidity with which the vocal music moves through stretches of octave-hopping angularity, Sprechstimme and poplike styles. Carla Kihlstedt's dark-hued, vibrato-free soprano and energetic violin draw a focused emotional intensity from this unsettled quality.Ms. Bielawa does her own singing in "A Collective Cleansing" (2000), but where Ms. Kihlstedt's performance was recorded without overdubbing, Ms. Bielawa's is a study in electronic technique. She makes her way through the Aeschylus text as a soloist, as both voices in closely harmonized duets and as a thick-textured chorus, with spatial effects and rumbling electronic sounds. The results are stylized and seductive, with a sense of melding the antique and the futuristic.That effect also animates "Lamentations for a City" (2004), in which an overlay of whispering gives the wrenching emotionality of the Jeremiah text setting a haunted quality, and an English horn line amplifies the changing mood of the choral writing, rendered here by the vocal ensemble Cerddorion. ALLAN KOZINN ROCK music's past and its present live side by side in New York, though the line that splits the two is porous. When it closed in 2006, CBGB, on the Bowery — to many the birthplace of punk — seeped into the past. And when the '80s rock group Duran Duran played the Hammerstein Ballroom last June, you might say they seeped back into the present, however briefly.The old New York music scene is fun to tour around and talk about (here's where Bob Dylan shot an album cover, there's where the Ramones hung out), but the new scene is more fun at night for one big reason: it still exists. The best way to spend a rock 'n' roll weekend in the city, naturally, is to mix both the old and the new into your visit.You can cover history by joining Ron Colinear, a Ramones-crazy 40-something with spiky bleached blond hair, for a tour of the East Village, which starts outside Joey Ramone's former building at 115 East Ninth Street several times a week and wends its way past sites like the former home of the Fillmore East, at 105 Second Avenue, the concert hall that played host to everyone from the Grateful Dead, the Who and the Allman Brothers but is now a bank; Madonna's first New York apartment at 234 East Fourth Street; and the building at 96-98 St. Marks Place that was featured on the cover of Led Zeppelin's "Physical Graffiti" album.Just how much things have changed is pretty obvious: the East Village is no longer a gritty hood and the "Physical Graffiti" building now houses the Physical Graffiti consignment shop. Adorable. Mr. Colinear — who goes by the stage name Bobby Pinn for the tour — also weaves in advice (a coupon for his favorite record store) and a sermon (why the building at 315 Bowery, which housed CBGB, should be given landmark status). He also has some good stories, like the one about a woman on his tour who became heroic in the eyes of her adolescent grandson for remembering (hazily) how she used to hang out at at Andy Warhol's Dom — the club that later became the Electric Circus — on St. Mark's Place.There are rock landmarks beyond the East Village, of course: Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Studios on West Eighth; Bob Dylan's first apartment, at 161 West Fourth Street; Strawberry Fields in Central Park; and the Ed Sullivan Theater, home now to David Letterman but once, of course, host to the Beatles. (Mr. Colinear also runs custom tours to these spots and others.)Come nighttime, you're on your own. But there are plenty of places to hear music in New York, places where the night's slate of up-and-coming bands is written on chalkboards and the person at the door asks if you're there to see any group in particular as they take your $8 or $12 or $20.The Lower East Side is the closest Manhattan gets to what the Village used to be: there's something going on pretty much every night at mainstay venues like Mercury Lounge on Houston and Arlene's Grocery, which still maintains the facade (and name) of the bodega it used to be.The younger, very popular Pianos follows Arlene's Grocery protocol, keeping the "Pianos" name and sign from the store that was there when it was conceivable that a piano store might make it on the Lower East Side. Pianos is kind of an entertainment multiplex. The bar there doesn't just feel like the antechamber to the performance space; it could stand on its own. There are two stages: one that has free shows upstairs in a funky loungelike setting and later brings on a D.J. spinning eclectic dance music; and one in a back room on the main floor where past concerts have found groups like Andrew W. K. and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah performing. There is also a surprisingly respectable menu, serving what seems like standard bar food that has been on "Extreme Makeover: Burger and Mozzarella Sticks Edition." So there's the red wine burger encrusted in black pepper, and fried mozzarella served with a sauce called not "marinara" but "roasted basil tomato."Still, the Williamsburg circuit is where it's at. One clear sign: Luna Lounge actually was born on the Lower East Side in 1995 and moved to Brooklyn in 2005. The new space showcases all that is different about Williamsburg venues: many times bigger and enough local hipsters to fill it. GlassLands Gallery, across from the old Domino Sugar factory on the East River, holds concerts a few times a week, but also doubles, triples, quadruples and quintuples as a do-it-yourself art space, an after-school program, a lecture hall and a private party site. The ever-changing art that coats the walls gives a dreamy feel to the space, especially when it is rocking with groups like Heavy Trash, as it was on a recent weekend.Other must-stops are two cavernous spaces: Studio B in warehouse land, Brooklyn, which follows its live shows with huge dance parties, and Warsaw, housed in the still-active Polish National Home in the traditionally Polish, long-hipsterfying neighborhood of Greenpoint. The changing neighborhood makes for an odd snack menu at Warsaw: young concertgoers chase pierogi, kielbasa and blintzes with Polish beer. Store that memory to tell your grandchildren when you tour the area later this century.
