CLASSICALFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.Opera'CARMEN' (Saturday and Wednesday) It takes a powerful singer to make a strong impression amid the flamboyant spectacle of Franco Zeffirelli's crowded 1996 production. But the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, whose Carmen is a sultry, rich-voiced seductress, has the voice and personality to stand out from the cavorting children, crowds, dancers and barnyard menagerie. Marcelo Álvarez is an ardent and believable Don José. Krassimira Stoyanova is Micaëla, Lucio Gallo sings Escamillo and on Wednesday the title role will be reprised by Nancy Fabiola Herrera. Emmanuel Villaume conducts with grace and vigor. Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out on Saturday, $175 tickets remaining for Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer)'THE DANGEROUS LIAISONS' (Saturday) Dicapo Opera Theater presents Conrad Susa's setting of the 18th-century exercise in sadism by Choderlos de Laclos. At 8 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $55. (Bernard Holland)★ 'MANON LESCAUT' (Saturday) The Met has dusted off its drearily realistic 1980 production of Puccini's "Manon Lescaut"  for one reason: Karita Mattila. This charismatic Finnish soprano gives a riveting portrayal of the title role, singing with the requisite richness and power, yet conveying girlish awkwardness. The tenor Marcello Giordani may bring stylish Italianate ardor to his portrayal of Manon's lover, the chevalier des Grieux, but his singing is overly emotive, sometimes sloppy and blatant. The esteemed conductor Donald Runnicles takes over for James Levine in this final performance of the run. At 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)'OTELLO' (Friday and Tuesday) The title role in Verdi's "Otello" is one of the great vocal and acting challenges for a tenor in the Italian repertory. The acclaimed South African tenor Johan Botha brings power, rich tone, confident delivery and elegance to the role, his first Otello at the Met. Still, over all his performance is dramatically bland. Renée Fleming, singing Desdemona at the Met for the first time since 1995, gives a vulnerable, poignant and vocally classy performance. Carlo Guelfi is an idiomatic and intelligent though not particularly gripping Iago.  At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)'PETER GRIMES' (Thursday) Britten's profound seafaring tragedy returns to the Metroplitan with the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey in the title role and the soprano Patricia Racette as Ellen Orford. Donald Runnicles conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $26 to $250. (Holland)★ 'LA SONNAMBULA' (Wednesday) The rising Cuban-born soprano Eglise Gutierrez takes on the touchstone role of Amina in Bellini's "Sonnambula" with the Opera Orchestra of New York. The cast in this concert performance at Carnegie Hall includes the tenor Dmitry Korchak as Elvino and the bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as Count Rodolfo. The indispensable Eve Queler, the founder of this popular enterprise, conducts. Over the years she has shown a special affinity for the Bel Canto repertory. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)Classical Music★ ALARM WILL SOUND (Thursday) Alan Pierson leads his enterprising young ensemble in a typically eclectic program that includes the New York premiere of John Adams's "Son of Chamber Symphony" and works that range from thorny scores by Nancarrow, Ligeti and Harrison Birtwistle to early music by Josquin and Ciconia and transcriptions of electronica by Aphex Twin and Mochipet. But the real surprise here is likely to be a version of "Philosophy of the World" by the Shaggs, a sister band from the late 1960s and early '70s that attracted a following amused by the ineptitude of its songwriting and playing. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Allan Kozinn)★ AXIOM (Wednesday) Anticipating the Messiaen centenary in December, Jeffrey Milarsky leads this energetic Juilliard ensemble in Messiaen's vivid mystical vision "Des Canyons aux Etoiles." At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)★ BARGEMUSIC (Friday through Sunday) There's plenty of action on the barge this weekend, starting on Friday with the music of Luis Prado, Arvo Pärt, Prokofiev and Janacek, performed by the violinist Johnny Gandelsman and the pianist Francesco Tristano Schlimé. On Saturday and Sunday the pianist Doris Stevenson, the cellist Carlos Prieto and the violinist Mark Peskanov  (Bargemusic's artistic director) unite for the American premiere of Samuel Zyman's Suite for Cello Solo and works by Martinu, Smetana and Dvorak. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students. (Schweitzer)BRENTANO STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) The Brentano players take a look at what prominent composers were thinking toward the end of their careers. The music is Mozart's "Prussian" Quartet, Elliott Carter's Piano Quintet with Thomas Sauer, Bartok's last quartet and the Contrapunctus XIV from Bach's "Art of Fugue." At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Holland)★ CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Friday and Sunday) The main draw at this concert, the final program in the perhaps overhyped "American Voices" series, should be the premiere of Alan Louis Smith's "Vignettes: Covered Wagon Woman." This substantial song cycle for mezzo-soprano, which sets to music the diary entries of a woman who crossed to the West alone in a covered wagon, was written for the astounding Stephanie Blythe, who is having a breakout season. The program includes pieces by Anthony Philip Heinrich, Gottschalk and Ives. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $50 to $29. (Tommasini)CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday and Tuesday) A great orchestra, a fine pianist and singer, and one of music's truly important minds bring two interesting programs to Carnegie Hall. Pierre Boulez is the conductor for both evenings. Matthias Pintscher's "Osiris" will have its first New York performance on Monday, accompanied by Debussy's great orchestral suite, "Images," and the Bartok Third Piano Concerto with Mitsuko Uchida. Tuesday brings Berio's "Quatre Dédicaces" and Stravinsky's "Petrouchka"; Susan Graham will sing Berlioz's "Nuits d'Été." At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $128. (Holland)DAVID FINCKEL AND WU HAN (Tuesday) This husband-and-wife cello-and-piano duo returns to the Morgan Library's shiny, tiny new hall with sonatas by Beethoven and Brahms, and two sets of pieces by Anton Webern. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; $45. (Holland)MARKUS GROH (Sunday) This German pianist, who recently recorded works by Liszt for the Avie label, offers a colorful program including the composer's monumental Sonata in B Minor. The lineup also includes Schulhoff's "Five Études de Jazz," Ginastera's Sonata No. 1 and works by Kurtag and Ligeti. At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Schweitzer)JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Saturday). The Juilliard School makes a trip to Carnegie Hall with James DePreist conducting the Juilliard Orchestra. Of interest is Chen Yi's "Ge Xu." Familiar will be the Prokofiev Third Piano Concerto, with Stephen Beus as soloist. Everyone should recognize the Berlioz "Symphonie Fantastique," which threatens to be the most played symphonic piece in New York this season. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $10 to $25. (Holland)★ JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Saturday and Monday) In 1900, when the series that became the Peoples' Symphony Concerts got going, an individual ticket cost 10 cents. Amazingly, ticket prices for the 12 Saturday concerts this season haven't risen much, adjusted for 108 years of inflation. On Saturday night s the Juilliard String Quartet plays a program of works by Beethoven, Shostakovich and Verdi. Yes, Verdi wrote an impassioned string quartet. On Monday, the quartet will play a free concert at the Juilliard School of Music that includes works by Hayden, Carter and Verdi. Saturday at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. Monday at 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; limited ticket availability, call in advance.  (Tommasini)★ KRONOS QUARTET (Friday) Surprises, mostly pleasant ones, are always plentiful when the Kronos performs. Here they offer new and recent scores by Gary Leport, Clint Mansell, Fernando Otero, Aviya Kopelman, John Adams and Aleksandra Vrebalov. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Kozinn) ★ MIDORI (Sunday) This excellent violinist offers the second installment of a three-part series exploring parallels and contrasts between the music of Alfred Schnittke and Toru Takemitsu. On Sunday the spotlight is on Schnittke. Midori will be joined by musicians including the fine pianist Marc-André Hamelin and the Daedalus Quartet for Schnittke's Sonata No.1 and Septet, Shostakovich's Piano Quintet in G minor and Bach's Trio Sonata in G. At 5 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway and 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $60. (Schweitzer)MMARTISTS IN CONCERT (Friday) The fine musicians of the resident ensemble of the Metropolitan Museum of Art have started going by the catchy (if unusual to read) name MMArtists in Concert. Friday's program offers string quintets by Beethoven and Dvorak framing the modernist American composer Charles Wuorinen's Piano Quintet. At 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $35. (Tommasini)MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Saturday and Sunday) This organization offers New Yorkers a chance to discover traditional and contemporary Japanese music. A two-day minifestival opens on Saturday with "Exploring Ma: Ancient Winds and Percussion," a program of repertory chosen for its use of "ma," or powerful silence. Works by John Cage, Toru Takemitsu and Hiroya Miura (a premiere) will be juxtaposed with music from Japan's gagaku tradition. On Sunday, the premieres of works by three established Japanese composers will be presented, followed by a question-and-answer session. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20, or $35 for both concerts. (Schweitzer)ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Saturday and Sunday) This fine chamber ensemble celebrates the 70th birthday of Joan Tower, who concludes her 10-year stint as the Orchestra of St. Luke's composer in residence this year. The first of three programs focusing on music by Tower, her contemporaries and those who influenced her takes place Saturday, with excerpts from Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time," the final movement of Shostakovich's Piano Trio No. 2, Stravinsky's "Elégie" for solo violin, the premiere of a work by Sergei Tcherepnin, and Ms. Tower's "For Daniel" for violin, cello and piano. Saturday at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street; Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y.; $25. Information: (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org. (Schweitzer)SO PERCUSSION AND KNEEBODY (Friday) Here is a promising collaboration between two inventive ensembles: a virtuosic percussion ensemble and a band of freewheeling postmodernists. At 7 p.m., Whitney Museum of American Art,  (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. Free with museum admission, which is pay what you wish after 6. (Kozinn)RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA (Saturday and Sunday) In past visits, Vladimir Jurowski has done wonders with this independent Russian ensemble. Now that he has been anointed as one of the most insightful conductors of his generation, his two Lincoln Center concerts are bound to be hot tickets. On Saturday he leads Schubert's "Unfinished" Eighth Symphony (heard here in a completion by Anton Safronov) and the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1, with Stephen Hough as the soloist. On Sunday, Garrick Ohlsson is the soloist in the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, which shares the bill with the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6. Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)The Manhattan School of Music created a prototypical halfway house — a graduate program in orchestral performance — intended to help gifted students make their way from school to professional life. Its curriculum has been heavy on the practical: from learning symphonic as opposed to solo repertory to understanding the psychopathology of orchestra life and even to tips on travel.Manhattan's current class came to Zankel Hall on Saturday to show its progress in a program of Vivaldi and Mozart. Pinchas Zukerman is a prominent teacher at the school, and here he played the violin and viola and conducted the Manhattan School of Music Chamber Sinfonia. The bright young German violinist Viviane Hagner joined him in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola (K. 364). After intermission Mr. Zukerman conducted Mozart's "Linz" Symphony.These are good young players. The ensemble is well tuned, reasonably together and certainly not lacking in enthusiasm. Its size was not right for the space. An orchestra of eight violins apiece in its first and second sections simply overpowered this smallish recital hall. The musicians' flat-out eagerness  also contributed to the bluntness of sound.Understandably, slow movements worked best by forcing less. Here, young players relaxed and allowed their natural musicality to come out of hiding. Ms. Hagner and Mr. Zukerman were not the best match — she fine and precise, he bluffer and broader — but the magic of Mozart's Andante movement had its desired effect. For the same reasons the Poco Adagio of the "Linz" sang very nicely.The best of this evening may have come at the start, in Vivaldi's B-minor Concerto for four violins, cello and strings. The music was inventive, the energy of the playing pointed and the mood cheerful. Commentators who say  Vivaldi wrote the same concerto hundreds of times should have their ears examined. Mr. Zukerman, here a violinist, was as always an exceptional instrumentalist and was joined by Amaury Coeytaux, Bela Horvath and Daniel Khalikov, all good. Elizabeth Means was the cellist.COULD the secret to having enough money in retirement be as simple as working a bit longer? Writing in AARP magazine, Jonathan D. Pond, a financial planner, argues yes.Some 71 percent of Americans said in a recent survey commissioned by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans that they were worried about having enough money to retire.  Mr. Pond's response is: work a few more years.To explain why, he writes about a fictional 63-year-old he calls Betty. She  earns $50,000 a year and has $200,000 in retirement savings. If Betty retired today, she would receive $12,000 a year from Social Security. And if she withdrew 5 percent of her nest egg to live on, she would have $22,000 in annual income.But if Betty waited until age 66 to retire, not only would her Social Security benefits increase — to $16,000 a year — but so would her savings. Assuming she contributed $10,000 a year to her 401(k) in those three additional years of working, and assuming her retirement fund grew by 6 percent a year, Betty's nest egg would be worth $270,000, Mr. Pond says. Withdrawing 5 percent would give her $13,500, bringing her total income to $29,500, or 34 percent more than she would have had at age 63. If she waited to age 69 to retire, using the same assumptions, her income would be $38,650, nearly 76 percent more than at age 63.BLAND PRAISE Balanced funds and target-date funds —  balanced funds that are more conservative over time — have become the two most popular  default options in the retirement plans that companies offer employees, Financial Planning notes. The question is,  Which performs better?Craig L. Israelsen, who teaches personal finance  at Brigham Young University, tested hypothetical portfolios that mirrored the holdings of most balanced and target-date (also called life-cycle) funds. In the balanced portfolio,  50 percent was invested in  companies  in the United States, 10 percent in companies outside the United States, 30 percent in bonds and 10 percent in cash. The target-date fund began with 90 percent equities and 10 percent fixed-income investments, steadily shifting more funds to fixed-income over time, and ending with a mix of 40 percent in equities and 60 percent in bonds and cash.Mr. Israelsen tracked how the two funds would have done from  1960 through  2007. The winner by a small margin (9.59 percent to 9.26 percent) was the target-date fund.Both types of fund "generally deliver middle-of-the-road returns compared with the core individual assets in an accumulation portfolio; they usually outperform bonds or cash, and underperform one or both of the equity components," he writes. "As such, either a balanced or target-date fund may appear relatively bland. But, bland is good. Investing isn't supposed to be exciting."VAMPIRE ENERGY "Even when household appliances are turned off, most are still using some electricity," Good magazine notes. "Appliances are either in passive standby mode (the clock on the microwave is still ticking) or active standby mode (the VCR is off, but programmed to record something)."You may have known that. But you probably did not know how much that "vampire energy," as the magazine puts it, costs. The answer is, a lot. For example, in the active standby mode, a plasma TV consumes about $160 of electricity a year and a game console $25.73. In the passive standby mode, a laser printer costs $12.43 a year and a laptop $15.90.FINAL TAKE It may not rank with the invention of penicillin, or even sliced bread, but it could make time spent at rock concerts less boring.Popular Mechanics reports a major music company has created a self-tuning electric guitar. "The Gibson Robot Guitar ($2,499) puts an end to the manual peg-twisting," the magazine says. Microprocessors determine which strings need tuning, and motors tune the strings in seconds.Rock on.The audience at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night, which spilled over into stage seats, would have been happy to let the ovations for Alfred Brendel go on and on. But after a substantive program devoted to the Classical masters he has championed and three encores, Mr. Brendel crossed his arms over his chest in gratitude and signaled that that was it. The time had come. With one more bow, he left the stage and ended the New York chapter of his towering 60-year career.This acclaimed Austrian pianist, who has lived in London since the early 1970s, will retire from the concert stage at the end of the year. Wednesday's recital and a performance last Sunday of Mozart's Concerto No. 24 with the Met Orchestra and James Levine, also at Carnegie Hall, were his last New York appearances.At 77, Mr. Brendel looks spry and energetic. He certainly played through demanding pieces by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert with what seemed undiminished focus, utter integrity and a penchant for surprise. His account of Schubert's mystical late Sonata in B flat was particularly transfixing: spacious, searching and calmly eloquent. Even in its scherzo, for all the humor, delicacy and grace of his playing, Mr. Brendel conveyed the somber undertow, with sudden turns in the middle section to ominous harmonies and jumpy bass lines.But Mr. Brendel has been grappling with a mild form of arthritis and finds the concert circuit tiring. He is a man of wide-ranging interests, including painting and writing (both essays and humorous German prose poems). And he is a devoted teacher.Because Mr. Brendel has concentrated on the Classical masters, he has been viewed as a self-appointed guardian of that heritage. Yet he never made this claim for himself. Instead he has been immersed in a personal and lifelong examination of music he finds continually rewarding and elusive. During his day he played an enormous amount of repertory, including  unlikely virtuosic touchstones like  Prokofiev's Fifth Piano Concerto and Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition." But his landmark early recordings of the complete works of Beethoven on the Vox label brought him to attention and identified him for the public.Even in his chosen repertory, his playing over the years has sometimes come across as dutiful and dry. In his effort to serve these great scores he can seem pedantic to some. At his best, he disappears into the music. He was at his best here: relaxed, sensitive and spontaneous.He began with an eerily calm performance of Haydn's Variations in F minor, pensive music that slips into rhapsodic bursts of chromatic harmony and spiraling passagework. Then he offered a fascinating, rather cagey account of Mozart's Sonata in F, from 1788, a work at once deceptively simple and strangely elaborate. In Beethoven's Sonata No. 13 in E flat —  which, like its Opus 27 companion, the "Moonlight," is labeled "quasi una fantasia" —  Mr. Brendel captured the music's fantastical elements in his vibrant yet lucidly structured performance. If some contrapuntal runs got a little tangled up during the bumptious finale, it mattered little, for all the brio and rustic character of the playing.After his first encore, a ruminative performance of the slow movement from Bach's "Italian Concerto," Mr. Brendel gave a breezy account of Liszt's "Au Lac de Wallenstadt," music lightly tinged with Spanish rhythms. Mr. Brendel was once a major exponent of Liszt. Why has he not played more such pieces in recent years? With his final encore, a lyrically supple and unsentimental performance of Schubert's familiar Impromptu in G flat, came the answer. "This is what I do," the message seemed to be. "This is who I am."Unfailingly demure, stalwartly upbeat and blessed with a vocal technique second to none, Maureen McGovern might be described as the Julie Andrews of the Love Generation. Because she has devoted most of the last 25 years to a pop-jazz, Broadway and light classical repertory, I hadn't thought of her quite that way until her captivating new show, "A Long and Winding Road," at the Metropolitan Room.In the program, which plays irregularly through Feb. 23, she applies the pop-standard test to rock-era songs. The ones she has chosen — by Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Jimmy Webb and others — pass with honors.In that exam Ms. McGovern and her musical director and pianist, Jeff Harris (with Jay Leonhart on bass), transform astutely selected folk and soft-rock songs, many composed on guitar, into more formal, piano-based pieces performed with a recitalist's discipline and precision. Ms. McGovern has perfect intonation, impeccable enunciation and the dynamic control and the vocal flexibility of a classical lieder singer.Her vocal texture, with its softened vibrato and nasality at the upper end suggests a folk-jazz Barbra Streisand with an extra octave. The style she uses about half the time is unaffected, pure folk-pop crooning, sometimes a cappella.This chronologically nonlinear musical scrapbook of baby boom music, from the 1960s to the early '70s, begins with a fragment of Joni Mitchell's "All I Want" attached to Paul Simon's "America" and ends with a verse of Ms. Mitchell's "Woodstock," leading to John Lennon's "Imagine."There is soft-edged humor. Amusing bits include " '60s Silly Syllables," a skillfully executed medley of nonsensical doo-wop intros, and Tom Lehrer's blasphemous "Vatican Rag," offered as a response to what Ms. McGovern on Thursday called her "1950s and '60s Catholic girl experience." Parodying Connie Francis singing "Where the Boys Are," she captured Ms. Francis's overbearing whine while lending the song twice the vocal heft than Ms. Francis ever put into it.Although nothing rates below a B, most of the songs that get A+'s  are those originally composed on piano, especially those by the still under-regarded Jimmy Webb. The exquisite gentleness with which she renders "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" makes its characters in a song he wrote as a teenager sound painfully young and vulnerable. Performing "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress," Ms. McGovern holds back until the emotional dam bursts, and she briefly lets the torrents rage before reining the song back in.Ms. McGovern brings her jazz know-how to Laura Nyro's "And When I Die" and unleashes glimpses of a full-tilt ferocity that suggests that there is a drowsy tiger stirring inside this nice Catholic schoolgirl from Youngstown, Ohio. It is more than she has ever shown before.FILMSTONY BROOK Charles B. Wang Center "Behind Forgotten Eyes," documentary by Anthony Gilmore. Feb. 25 at 7 p.m. Free.

He was 75 and lived in Redding, Conn.The cause was colon cancer, said Bob Gallo, the spokesman for Musica Sacra.Mr. Westenburg was a lively, inspiring director who kept close tabs on changing musicological notions about the performance of Baroque works but balanced those prescriptions with his own strongly etched sense of style, usually with stimulating results. His signature work was Handel's "Messiah," in which he led Musica Sacra at Carnegie Hall most years at Christmastime.In the late 1970s Mr. Westenburg's "Messiah" performances were widely considered the best in New York. His  choir was a trim ensemble of between 30 and 35 singers, and his brisk readings offered a striking contrast to the mammoth Victorian "Messiah" performances that had become commonplace. In a review in The New York Times in 1977, Allen Hughes wrote that Mr. Westenburg's interpretation "probably comes about as close as possible to an ideal representation of the work in terms of current musicological information and present-day demands of musical performance in general."Mr. Westenburg's 1981 recording of "Messiah" with Musica Sacra, on RCA Red Seal,  was highly regarded in its time and remains a favorite.When recordings and live performances by ensembles using period instruments became more plentiful, and the Musica Sacra "Messiah" came to seem dated, Mr. Westenburg was not complacent. Although he did not make the move to period instruments, he hired orchestra players conversant with the sound and style that early-music specialist bands produced. And from the 1990s on he seemed intent on reconciling several competing schools of thought about "Messiah," seeking to retain the sharp focus of his reduced choral sound while at the same time embracing the velvety tone, expansiveness and grandeur of more traditional, large-scale performances.Beyond "Messiah," Mr. Westenburg commanded a vast repertory that stretched from the works of Hildegard of Bingen, the 12th-century abbess and composer, to contemporary scores by Ligeti, Messiaen, David Diamond and Meredith Monk. Over the years Musica Sacra gave memorable performances of the Monteverdi Vespers, Haydn's "Creation," the Verdi Requiem, Liszt's "Christus," the Fauré Requiem and Bach's St. Matthew Passion and Mass in B minor.In 1979 Mr. Westenburg started and directed a Bach festival at Lincoln Center — it was called Basically Bach, a play on the alliterative name of the center's successful Mostly Mozart festival — which ran for a decade. Although his performances with Musica Sacra were at its core, the festival also offered chamber music, instrumental recitals and choral concerts led by other conductors.Richard Westenburg was born in Minneapolis on April 26, 1932, and won several small piano competitions as a child. As a teenager he became interested in the organ, and in 1954 he earned his Bachelor of Music degree as an organist at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis. He completed a master's in musicology, with a minor in film, at the University of Minnesota in 1956, and in 1959 he went to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, Pierre Cochereau and Jean Langlais.After two years as director of music at the First Unitarian Church in Worcester, Mass., he moved to New York in 1962 and enrolled at the Union Theological Seminary. He joined the faculty at the seminary in 1963 and completed his doctorate in sacred music in 1968.In 1964 Mr. Westenburg was hired as organist and choirmaster at Central Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, and he quickly assembled an early version of the Musica Sacra Choir. During his 10 years at the church, Musica Sacra not only performed as its resident choir but gave public performances as well, and began to win a following. So did Mr. Westenburg himself, as music director of the Collegiate Chorale from 1973 to 1980 and as a popular lecturer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 1982.When he left Central Presbyterian Church to become conductor in residence at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in 1974, he brought Musica Sacra with him. But the choir was having financial troubles and canceled its public concerts in 1975. Its "Messiah" performance that year became a symbol of the ensemble's determination: the concert was held in Mr. Westenburg's living room, with the choristers and listeners partaking of a potluck dinner before the performance.Mr. Westenburg assembled a board, and within five years the choir was thriving. When another financial crisis hit in 1994, his choristers, who are paid for their work, waived their fees for a few concerts, which were offered as benefits for the organization. In 1990 Mr. Westenburg became music director at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, again bringing Musica Sacra with him to perform at the church sometimes.In addition to conducting, Mr. Westenburg taught choral music and conducting at the Mannes College of Music from 1971 to 1977, and led the choral department at the Juilliard School from 1977 to 1989. He was also a visiting professor at Rutgers University from 1986 to 1992.Mr. Westenburg, whose two marriages ended in divorce,  is survived by his sons Eric,  of Reno, Nev., and Mario,  of Redding; his daughters, Kirsten Westenburg Barnhorst of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., and Nadia Westenburg of Redding; and six grandchildren.
