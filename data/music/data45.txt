The stage of Weill Recital Hall became a crowded playpen of percussion instruments for Martin Grubinger's evening of new and recent music on Friday. Had the stage been a little bigger, there would have been more of them. Mr. Grubinger, a young Austrian, had to change his program for an unanticipated lack of space.Stretched from one side to the other were snare drums at stage right; other drums escalating in size to a Verdi Requiem-size bass drum at stage left; and in between a marimba and some of its close cousins. At various points, bells tinkled, and woodblocks knocked like woodpeckers at a spruce tree. Shouts were heard. There was also a grand piano (just another percussion instrument to the ears of many), played skillfully from time to time by Per Rundberg.Concerts like these drift inevitably away from profound musical messages and settle on the instruments themselves. What exotic sounds can the composer cook up? What level of complication can the performer rise to? Mr. Grubinger, with his flailing body and semiperpetual grin, is master of the high-speed chase. He can also go from barely audible triple-pianos to earsplitting ultrafortissimos.His own piece "Aus dem Leben einer  Trommel" examines the career possibilities of various snare drums, which Mr. Grubinger alternately tapped, scraped, brushed and beat the daylights out of. He also confirmed his ambidextrous talent for playing different meters at the same time.Mr. Grubinger's monstrous fluency as a mallet percussionist was on display in Anders Koppel's Marimba Concerto No. 3, with Mr. Rundberg's piano standing in for the intended orchestra part. It also showed up in Minoru Miki's "Marimba Spiritual," a piece proving once again that sheer volume of physical activity is no substitute for interesting content. Evelyn Glennie's "Little Prayer," hushed and hymnlike, came dangerously close to easy listening.I especially liked Mr. Koppel's Toccata, which was as clear-voiced as his concerto was thick and aggressive. A good percentage of the evening kept referring to African music as filtered through North and South American cultures. The Toccata veered between the tango and old-fashioned waltz time, the piano line delicately ornamented by marimba flurries.Iannis Xenakis's "Rebonds B," with its alternating bass drum and woodblocks, was the evening's shortest yet most substantial moment, offering a sobriety and studied imagination that made a lot of the music around it seem not very important at all.Routes from the Appalachians, the bayou, Texas, Chicago, Memphis, New York and New Orleans converge at a geographically unlikely but historically proven nexus: Woodstock, N.Y., where Levon Helm has a home studio in a barn. Mr. Helm, 67, played drums and sang in the Band, which recorded "The Basement Tapes" with Bob Dylan and made its indelible debut album in neighboring West Saugerties, N.Y. He has been putting on monthly concerts in Woodstock called Midnight Rambles since 2005. At those shows, Mr. Helm leads a core band while friends drop in, and lately he has taken the idea on the road.On Friday night, starting a two-night stand at the Beacon Theater, the Levon Helm Band's show was a romping rock-R&B-country-blues revue. It had guitarists (Larry Campbell and Jimmy Vivino) who dispensed ragtime, blues-rock and more; a five-man horn section that played soul riffs and raucous traditional jazz; female singers representing country, soul and rock;  and a repertory spanning a good stretch of the 20th century.In a way, Mr. Helm was unraveling the strands of American music that he and the Band had entwined. Nearly all the songs were old, from the Band and from the Americana archives. And many were forlorn, whether they were honky-tonk weepers or jovial shuffles. They were bound  by Mr. Helm's stalwart yet flexible drumming and, often, his backwoods yowl of a voice, fully recovered from throat cancer. After more than two hours onstage — drumming, singing, playing mandolin — a grinning Mr. Helm stood up and did jumping jacks.Mr. Helm's drum kit was placed sideways on the band's right flank, making all the subtlety of his playing visible. He had the bedrock timing and well-chosen patterns of a great roadhouse drummer, but was never mechanical. He chose whether each cymbal tap would ring or hiss, and he kicked verses toward choruses with a different syncopated flourish every time around.He didn't sing the whole set. Other band members took turns and so did guests including Phoebe Snow, belting high notes to please the crowd; she sang Van Morrison's "Into the Mystic," a song he recorded in Woodstock. Little Sammy Davis, in a derby hat, sang the blues and played harmonicas he pulled from pockets of his tuxedo. Teresa Williams brought a true country twang to songs like "Long Black Veil," and Catherine Russell strutted through a song Marcia Ball has recorded, "Soulful Dress."One Midnight Ramble regular was missing: Mr. Helm's daughter, Amy Helm. She's a member of the opening band, Ollabelle, but she just gave birth to his grandson, named Levon. (Her husband, Jay Collins, played saxophone in the horn section.)Mr. Helm performed only a few songs from "Dirt Farmer" (Dirt Farmer Music/Vanguard), the Grammy-winning acoustic album he released last year. One was "Anna Lee," a stark waltz about a mother's death, accompanied only by Mr. Campbell's fiddle and mountain-harmony vocals from Ms. Williams and Ms. Russell. But most of the set was upbeat, with the horns pumping up the party spirit. For the Levon Helm Band, the way to face trouble is with a clear gaze, a steady backbeat and an ornery voice.CLASSICALFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.Opera'ERNANI' (Monday)  This is a Verdi opera more heard about than actually seen. The Met brings it back after a 23-year absence. The cast is first-rate: Marcello Giordani, Sondra Radvanovsky, Thomas Hampson and Ferruccio Furlanetto. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175.  (Bernard Holland)'FALSTAFF' (Wednesday and Friday) Leon Major's lively production of this Verdi comic opera returns to City Opera, with Jan Opalach in the title role. Pamela Armstrong is Alice Ford,  and Anna Skibinsky is Nannetta; George Manahan conducts. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130.(Vivien Schweitzer)★ 'KING ARTHUR' (Saturday) For his fantastical production of this Purcell opera, the choreographer Mark Morris has hijacked the composer's stunning score for arias, ensembles, choruses and dancers, tossing out every word of dialogue by John Dryden, essentially eliminating the story, and turning this "Dramatick Opera," as it was billed in 1691, into a de facto ballet. The audience is invited to experience the work as an impish yet elegant vaudeville show. As always the dancing is captivating, and Isaac Mizrahi's  costumes are amusingly imaginative. But the production is  a little too cute after a while. Still, it is a pleasure to hear this remarkable music, and Jane Glover conducts a fine cast of vocal soloists, the chorus and orchestra. At 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)★ 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Friday, Sunday and Thursday) Mark Lamos's strikingly elegant, spare production continues its spring run at the New York State Theater. The Chinese soprano Shu-Ying Li offers a vocally impressive and multilayered performance as Cio-Cio-San; the strong cast also includes James Valenti as Pinkerton, and Jennifer Tiller as Suzuki. This staging is also notable for the vibrantly choreographed role for Sorrow, Cio-Cio-San's young son, which further heightens the final tragedy. George Manahan conducts on Sunday and Thursday; Steven Mosteller conducts on Friday. Friday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Schweitzer)★ 'PETER GRIMES' (Saturday and Thursday) The acclaimed director John Doyle, who has mounted a new production of this 1945 Britten  masterpiece for the Met, has worked successfully to elicit subtle and involving portrayals from a winning cast. This is especially true of Anthony Dean Griffey, who gives a vulnerable, volatile and courageous performance as the title character.  Over all the musical performance, under the conductor Donald Runnicles, is urgent, probing and boldly romantic. But the production is dominated by a grim, five-tiered, wooden wall, to evoke the weathered clapboard dwellings of a small, and small-minded, fishing town, and looking at that wall as it shifts creakily about the stage gets very tiresome. The soprano Patricia Racette makes a sympathetic Ellen Orford, the schoolmistress who tries to reconcile Grimes to his neighbors.  Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; Saturday, $150; Thursday, $115 to $275. (Tommasini)'LA TRAVIATA' (Saturday and Wednesday) For this Franco Zeffirelli extravaganza, the current cast includes Ruth Ann Swenson, Jonas Kaufmann and Dwayne Croft. Saturday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.  (Holland) ★ 'TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' (Friday and Tuesday) Ben Heppner, the reigning Wagnerian tenor of our time, missed the first of six performances in the Met's revival of its 1999 production of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." His replacement, John Mac Master, tried valiantly to sing the role of Tristan, among the most daunting in the tenor repertory. But his voice was not up to the job. This made it hard to assess fully the work of Deborah Voigt, singing her first Isolde at the house. She sang with bright sound, unforced power and poignancy. But she was understandably tentative in scenes with her Tristan.  Still, Wagner fans must await the return of Mr. Heppner to size up the Met's revival. Replacing Mr. Heppner on Friday will be the tenor Gary Lehman, in his Met debut; a substitute for the Tuesday performance has yet to be announced. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)Classical Music★ PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Thursday) This French pianist finds Bach's "Art of Fugue" and Schoenberg's Five Piano Pieces to be kindred spirits. Also to be heard is Beethoven's A flat Sonata (Op. 110). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $86.(Holland)AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Ferdinand Hiller knew just about everybody worth knowing in 19th-century music but never made it big as a composer himself. Leon Botstein and his American Symphony Orchestra resurrect Hiller's oratorio "The Destruction of Jerusalem," and it should be interesting. At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, americansymphony.org; $27 to $55.  (Holland)BARGEMUSIC (Friday through Sunday) At this intimate floating concert hall on Friday, Nikita Storojev, bass, and Tatiana Stepanova, pianist, offer a tour of the Russian vocal repertory, with songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev. The rest of the weekend is given over to a trio that includes Olga Vinokur, pianist; Mark Peskanov, violinist; and Daniel Gaisford, cellist. Their program includes the Brahms Trio No. 3, Schubert's Sonatina for Violin and Piano (D. 384) and Michael Hersch's Sonata No. 2 for Unaccompanied Cello (2001) in its New York premiere. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+ (Friday only); $20 for students. (Allan Kozinn)BRENTANO STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) In its three "Examining Late Style" programs at Weill Recital Hall, this superb quartet is playing music that composers wrote late in their careers. As unifying concepts go, this has a guarantee of quality built in: few composers were considered to be at their best in their early years, and late works almost always have a patina of experience and depth. In the second of three installments, the group performs Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 6, Shostakovich's Quartet No. 15, and, with the clarinetist Todd Palmer, the magnificent Brahms Clarinet Quintet. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Kozinn)CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) This society pays tribute to Menachem Pressler, the pianist of the Beaux Arts Trio, and an important force in the world of chamber music. Mr. Pressler will join society artists and guests for a program that includes Mozart's Piano Quartet in E (K. 493) and Schubert's "Trout" Quintet, as well as Dvorak's attractive Terzetto for Two Violins and Viola. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 (sold out on Sunday). (Kozinn)JOEL FAN (Friday) This pianist makes his New York recital debut with an intriguingly eclectic program influenced by his experience performing with Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble. Mr. Fan will offer repertory including Chopin, Beethoven, Liszt, Prokofiev, Villa-Lobos, Dia Succari, Adnan Saygun and Qigang Chen. The program also has the New York premiere of Leon Kirchner's Sonata No. 3, "The Forbidden," written for Mr. Fan in 2006. At 7 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $25. (Schweitzer)KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON TRIO (Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) There are three chances this week to hear this estimable ensemble —  the pianist Joseph Kalichstein, the violinist Jaime Laredo and the cellist Sharon Robinson — who made their debut at President Carter's inauguration. The trio plays works by Handel-Halvorsen, Kodaly and Andy Stein ("Suite for Two") at Town Hall on Sunday afternoon, part of the essential Peoples' Symphony Concerts series. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday at the 92nd Street Y the players are joined by the violinist Leila Josefowicz and the violist Michael Tree for Stravinsky, Dvorak and Richard Danielpour (the New York premiere of "The Book of Hours"). Sunday at 2 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; sold out. Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40.(Tommasini)LANG LANG (Saturday) The flamboyance of this popular Chinese pianist may not be to everyone's taste, although he's certainly got technique to spare. But he has plenty of fans, and tickets to his concerts sell like hotcakes. Here Mr. Lang performs Mozart's Sonata in B flat (K. 333), Schumann's Fantasy in C (Op. 17) and music by Granados and Liszt. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $74 to $108. (Schweitzer)NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Friday, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Alan Gilbert, this orchestra's next music director, and Kurt Masur, its last one, are on hand this week and next, giving audiences a break from the preening exertions of Lorin Maazel, the current holder of the podium. Mr. Gilbert and the theater director Gerard McBurney collaborate on Friday on a short "Inside the Music" program, meant to elucidate Strauss's "Heldenleben." Mr. Gilbert leads the work on a regular program on Saturday, along with Mark Neikrug's Symphony No. 2, "Quintessence." Mr. Masur performs Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $25 to $104. (Kozinn)★ NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) With a nod to Leonard Bernstein on the 90th anniversary of his birth, this always impressive group presents a program titled "West Side Story." It opens, actually, with Brahms, but with a piece that celebrates youth, the "Academic Festival" Overture. A group of tone poems and choral works by Ives features the Symphony Singers. There will also be the premiere of "... among the leaves ..." by Jacob Bancks, for mezzo-soprano (Kate Lindsey) and orchestra. This adventurous orchestra includes a new work by a young composer on every program. The concert ends with Bernstein's exuberant Symphonic Dances from "West Side Story." Ryan McAdams, in his debut season as music director, conducts. At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, (212) 581-5933, nyys.org; $7 to $55.(Tommasini)★ PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Friday) Charles Dutoit has a long-standing relationship with this estimable ensemble, of whom he is incoming chief conductor, and the chemistry seems right with the Philadelphia musicians. They return to Carnegie Hall to perform Bartok's "Miraculous Mandarin" Suite, Debussy's Nocturnes and Holst's "Planets," for which the orchestra will be joined by women of the Philadelphia Singers Chorale. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $31 to $104. (Schweitzer)ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Saturday and Sunday) Last summer at Tanglewood, John Harbison devoted the annual Festival of Contemporary Music to works by composers born (as he was) in 1938. Other ensembles have taken up the idea, and the latest to do so, this chamber music arm of the Orchestra of St. Luke's, is joining the queue of well-wishers with " '38 Special," a program that includes William Bolcom's Serenata Notturna; John Corigliano's "Snapshot: Circa 1909" and Scherzo; John Harbison's Trio No. 2; and Joan Tower's String Quartet No. 1. Saturday at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street; Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org; $25. (Kozinn)TOKYO STRING QUARTET (Saturday) The 92nd Street Y's quartet in residence spends an evening in Central Europe. Featured are Webern's Quartet (Op. 28), Haydn's "Frog" Quartet from Op. 50, and Dvorak's lovely "American" Quartet. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Holland)NINE INCH NAILS"Ghosts I-IV"(The Null Corporation)Anything Radiohead can do, Trent Reznor can do his way. Nine Inch Nails, his recording project, has joined Radiohead among the million-sellers who are now free agents in the digital era, and his first move is radical: "Ghosts I-IV," an album made to be shared and altered freely."Ghosts I-IV" is 36 instrumental tracks (or near-instrumental, since human voices are among the sounds) and a coordinated set of elegantly eerie photographs. It's available as a high-fidelity, easily copied download for $5, a two-CD set for $16.99 (including shipping) and in deluxe versions from ghosts.nin.com; in April there will be a retail four-LP vinyl version for $39. The opening nine tracks are also available free, from ghosts.nin.com. Instead of a standard copyright, Mr. Reznor gave the music a Creative Commons license; it can be shared and reworked as long as music built on "Ghosts" is noncommercial and attributed to Nine Inch Nails.Mr. Reznor's collaborator on "Ghosts" is Atticus Ross, his programmer and co-producer; a few guest musicians like Adrian Belew add guitar and other noises. Even without verbal cues — the track titles are numbers — much of the music is still unmistakably Nine Inch Nails: overloaded electronic dance beats (3, 7, 16, 19, 24, 29), isolated piano notes and elegies (1, 9, 12, 36), pounding rock (4, 26, 27, 31, 35) or all of them together (10), usually in minor keys in the bleak, open soundscapes that Mr. Reznor has perfected. "Ghosts" also shows his pattern-building side, with plinking Steve Reich percussion in tracks 10 and 21, and tries some uncharacteristic sounds like thumb piano in 21, orchestral samples in 11 and banjo in 28.Most tracks can stand on their own, but they could also be heard as incomplete or anticipatory, potential soundtrack music or backing tracks for songs. Unlike Radiohead, which labors to make every song definitive and complete, Mr. Reznor has fully embraced a user-generated era. He has encouraged listeners to remix, "mutilate or destroy" the Nine Inch Nails catalog, even providing some separate instrumental parts. Now, with "Ghosts," he's virtually inviting other people's voices. It's Nine Inch Nails karaoke — add your own angst. JON PARELESSNOOP DOGG"Ego Trippin' "(Doggystyle/Geffen)The title of Snoop Dogg's ninth proper album could be taken as a defiant boast, a dispassionate disclaimer or perhaps a hazy combination of the two. More intriguing, "Ego Trippin' " hints at some existential quandaries with its suggestion of a stumble over selfhood. There probably isn't a better phrase to sum up this sleek but noticeably insecure record, which finds Snoop Dogg obsessed with defining just who, or what, he is.This isn't unusual terrain for a prominent rapper approaching his late 30s, the standard age of obsolescence for more than one high-stakes profession. Still, it's striking that Snoop Dogg can barely get half a minute into the album before defensively acknowledging his cartoonish television persona. Then, as one sultry, vintage sample (Marvin Gaye) segues into another (Isley Brothers), he lets loose with the first litany of boasts, in his laid-back yet shifty style.Throughout "Ego Trippin' " Snoop Dogg tries to burnish his credentials as a party-ready high roller, a street-toughened gangster, an insatiable lothario and a nurturing husband and father. He never acknowledges the incongruity of all these attributes, except by juxtaposition: "Those Gurlz," a groupie-seduction vignette, leads into "One Chance (Make It Good)," an avuncular bit of relationship advice.Acutely aware of his reputation for misogyny, Snoop Dogg grouses momentarily about freedom of speech. He dedicates "Been Around tha World" to his wife, but that track doesn't inspire much faith in his chivalry, let alone his fidelity. Naughtiness is still more his style, even if the album's explicit version of "Sensual Seduction" — his current Top 10 single, a robotic synth-pop track — is so clumsily suggestive that it verges on comedy."Sensual Seduction" was made by Shawty Redd, one of the few outside producers on the album. The greater portion of "Ego Trippin' " was overseen by QDT Muzic, a new production team consisting of DJ Quik, Teddy Riley and Snoop Dogg. They turn out an effective tangle of allusions to 1980s pop and present-day hip-hop, with diversions like "My Medicine," a slight but likable nod to Johnny Cash that was produced by Whitey Ford, a k a the rapper Everlast.In keeping with the album's title, Snoop Dogg lets only a few guests into his spotlight. (One of these, the rapper Too $hort from Oakland, Calif., will join him on Tuesday at the Blender Theater at Gramercy.) Snoop Dogg reserves a place of honor for Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band, who sings an earnest hook on the closing track, "Can't Say Goodbye."There, over a Bruce Hornsby-like piano part, Snoop Dogg offers the culmination of his soul search: a love song "to the blocks that raised me" and to the realness of the streets. "Critics wonder if I'm trying to be the Old Me," he muses, "but if they think the Old Me ever left/Then they don't really know me." Fair enough. But if the rest of "Ego Trippin' " is any indication, this rapper is just as confused on that point. NATE CHINEN KAKI KING"Dreaming of Revenge"(Velour)Kaki King is fighting against slightness. An acoustic guitarist of demonstrable skill — she used to demonstrate it all the time when she played by herself, tapping or slapping the strings, using the heel of her hand, deftly fingerpicking — she turned a corner a few years ago, taking a few steps away from fiddliness. She started working with a band. The message seemed to be that dexterity wasn't enough, except for a very small minority of players.She's still moving, though it's not clear where she'll end up. The technical displays are still there on "Dreaming of Revenge," which is more than half an instrumental record, and they can be jarring and disjunctive. With her legerdemain, Ms. King could have ended up in jazz, New Age or metal. But she ended up in indie rock, and her eager, fizzy playing feels at odds there; it's so unlike the studied slouchiness that typifies the musicianship in that world.Here she mostly spools out her intricate patterns in drifting postrock soundscapes, which are pleasant enough ("Sad American,"  "Montreal"). But when she sings a good, selfish pop song, she's on to something else entirely. The breakup songs "Life Being What It Is" and "2 O'Clock," sung in her small but determined voice, are full of power. They overshadow the rest of the record, put across strong melodies and still prove that she can play. BEN RATLIFF HOWLIN RAIN"Magnificent Fiend"(American/Birdman)This is a very silly record. Lots of young bands are deeply enthusiastic about early '70s rock, but Howlin Rain puts the others to shame. It mines a shallower level: second-tier mannerism and cliché.One way to act around clichés, if you're a rock musician whose work refers to an earlier period, is to avoid them. Another is to round up several thousand of the more homely ones, marry them all at once, tattoo their names on your body and live in bliss through the hard times. This is closer to what Howlin Rain does.Ethan Miller, the superenthusiastic singer, songwriter and guitarist of this sextet, has played for most of this decade with another band, Comets on Fire. But where that band is weird and austerely dedicated to tribal freak-out, Howlin Rain is comforting and good-timey. It makes a type of music you may have heard in bait-and-tackle shops and the backs of school buses, or maybe during lulls in the commercial-free rock block on your FM station. It is precisely B-list hard rock, like Wishbone Ash, Uriah Heep, Nazareth.Unlike Black Mountain, another current band with a '70s fixation, Howlin Rain is not facile or cold. Mr. Miller puts on a haggard, soul-man rock voice, as inauthentic as Chris Robinson's from the Black Crowes but wilder and uglier. The songs are written handsomely, and with effort: solemn introductions, multiple gear-shifting bridges, cruising solo passages. They're miles more accomplished than the songs on the band's self-titled first album from two years ago, though that one had a more rickety, excited vibe, with guitar fuzz like sonic vandalism. The new album, made with a revamped band behind Mr. Miller, is smoothed out, almost commercial by comparison.Mr. Miller plays his heart out, as does the band. He sings lines like "the wind calls the hangman to my name" and "Ruby, I chased your laughter with elephant wings," a slurry of stoner poetry. All of it may remind you not of a venerable old record, but of one that was bought cheap and didn't make the cut when you had to move your stuff out of your mom's house. BEN RATLIFF WHY should real musicians — the ones who can actually play their instruments — have all the fun?Some years ago, a group of frustrated people in Scotland decided that the pleasure of playing in an orchestra should not be limited to those who are good enough to do so, but should be available to the rankest of amateurs. So we founded the Really Terrible Orchestra, an inclusive orchestra for those who really want to play, but who cannot do so very well. Or cannot do so at all, in some cases.My own playing set the standard. I play the bassoon, even if not quite the whole bassoon. I have never quite mastered C-sharp, and I am weak on the notes above the high D. In general, I leave these out if they crop up, and I find that the effect is not unpleasant. I am not entirely untutored, of course, having had a course of lessons in the instrument from a music student who looked quietly appalled while I played. Most of the players in the orchestra are rather like this; they have learned their instruments at some point in their lives, but have not learned them very well. Now such people have their second chance with the Really Terrible Orchestra.The announcement of the orchestra's founding led to a great wave of applications to join. Our suspicion that there were many people yearning to play in an orchestra but who were too frightened or too ashamed to do anything about it, proved correct. There was no audition, of course, although we had toyed with the idea of a negative audition in which those who were too good would be excluded. This proved to be unnecessary. Nobody like that applied to join.Some of the members were very marginal musicians, indeed. One of the clarinet players, now retired from the orchestra for a period of re-evaluation, stopped at the middle B-flat, before the instrument's natural break. He could go no higher, which was awkward, as that left him very few notes down below. Another, a cellist, was unfortunately very hard of hearing and was also hazy on the tuning of the strings. As an aide-mémoire, he had very sensibly written the names of the notes in pencil on the bridge. This did not appear to help.At the outset, we employed a professional conductor, which is a must for anybody who is reading this and who is already planning to start a similar orchestra.Find somebody who is tolerant and has a sense of humor. The conductor also has to be sufficiently confident to be associated with something called the Really Terrible Orchestra; after all, it does go on the résumé.Our initial efforts were dire, but we were not discouraged. Once we had mastered a few pieces — if mastered is the word — we staged a public concert. We debated whether to charge for admission, but wisely decided against this. That would be going too far.So should we go to the other extreme and pay people to come? There was some support for this, but we decided against it. Instead, we would give the audience several free glasses of wine before the concert. That, it transpired, helped a great deal.We need not have worried. Our first concert was packed, and not just with friends and relations. People were intrigued by the sheer honesty of the orchestra's name and came to see who we were. They were delighted. Emboldened by the rapturous applause, we held more concerts, and our loyal audience grew. Nowadays, when we give our annual concert at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the hall is full to capacity with hundreds of music-lovers. Standing ovations are two-a-penny."How these people presume to play in public is quite beyond me," wrote one critic in The Scotsman newspaper. And another one simply said "dire." Well, that may be so, but we never claimed to be anything other than what we are. And we know that we are dire; there's no need to state the obvious. How jejune these critics can be!Even greater heights were scaled. We made a CD and to our astonishment people bought it. An established composer was commissioned to write a piece for us. We performed this and recorded it at a world premiere, conducted by the astonished composer himself. He closed his eyes. Perhaps he heard the music in his head, as it should have been. This would have made it easier for him.There is now no stopping us. We have become no better, but we plow on regardless. This is music as therapy, and many of us feel the better for trying. We remain really terrible, but what fun it is. It does not matter, in our view, that we sound irretrievably out of tune. It does not matter that on more than one occasion members of the orchestra have actually been discovered to be playing different pieces of music, by different composers, at the same time.

Toklas, ugly, smothering Alice, unloved by history and not even the author of "The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas." The creators of "27 Rue de Fleurus," a misguided new musical at Urban Stages, want to give her a chance to shine, to let her be the one who tells the story of her life with Gertrude Stein.Even with Alice in charge, Gertrude (Barbara Rosenblat) overwhelms. It's Gertrude's salon, Gertrude's genius, Gertrude's interruptions. For her part, Alice (Cheryl Stern) muses that she might have been a pianist or a writer. Mostly, though, she worries about why Gertrude chose her, and what it means to be her wife.Poor Gertrude Stein, Modernism's great experimenter, loved by history but here singing lines like, "I need a confidante each day/Tidy up my disarray." Her "rose is a rose" becomes "A Sapphist is a Sapphist is a Sapphist." And later, "A Negro is a Negro is a Negro" and a Jew is a, well, you know.There are good things in this production, smartly directed by Frances Hill. Roman Tatarowicz's attractive, light-filled set has Cubist angles and white frames enclosing shifting images. Ms. Rosenblat, who, seated, resembles portraits of Stein, plays Gertrude as a commanding bully. And Ms. Stern's Alice is a bright, attractive creature. ("Everyone is entitled to a bit of fantasy," she says.)  They're strong, plausible performances, if not exactly the Gertrude and Alice of lore.But Stein's art tossed out convention and invented its own rules, cadences and comedy. That makes her an inexplicable character for a play that's so conventional, especially lyrically and musically. (The bouncy, generic, pop-type songs bypass Modernism altogether.)And Alice remains Alice, the typist in charge of household affairs, the wife. "I am your muse/I am the woman behind the woman," she sings, and you understand that this musical (book and lyrics by Ted Sod, music and lyrics by Lisa Koch) has little new to say about the relationship.Denise Mina's bold, brave crime novels make up for all the indignities women suffer in genre fiction — especially the notion that a female protagonist is better off being likable than being real. Mina smashed that false article of faith with her dead-grim Garnethill trilogy, featuring a hard-bitten heroine who fights the social conditions that lead to the abuse of women, children and the elderly in a Glasgow slum. "Field of Blood" began a second series, not nearly as gritty but just as truthful, about Patricia Meehan, known as Paddy, a Glasgow newspaper "copyboy" ("so inconsequential she could have hanged herself at her desk without exciting comment") who develops into a first-rate crime reporter by investigating a series of child murders in her working-class neighborhood.By the time SLIP OF THE KNIFE (Little, Brown, $24.99) opens, in 1990, Paddy, now a newspaper columnist, is something of a local celebrity: "She had stumbled on a talent for articulating nationwide annoyances." But Paddy is still an investigative journalist at heart, and when someone murders Terry Hewitt, her first love, she's all over the case. That takes some courage, given the police theory that the killing was an I.R.A. hit and Paddy's own suspicion that Terry and a photographer who becomes the next victim were murdered because of the book they were working on.Paddy's potty mouth and irreverent attitude are good defenses in the rough-and-tumble world of cutthroat journalism. (One of the book's lowdown pleasures is watching a pack of story-hunting jackals terrorize a killer after his release from prison.) But despite her tough exterior, Paddy can't hide the essential decency she brings to a dirty job.Mina's realistic style gives her urban settings a smudged beauty as distinctive as the roaring wit of Glasgow's colorful citizens. Close characterization is another forte, and sizing people up at a glance is a specialty. "He was a small, bald man and as such didn't like to be seen doing small, bald things" pretty much takes care of a petty-minded editor. To grasp the sense of dislocation felt by a man fresh out of prison, all you need to know is that "the last time he was in a car his feet hardly touched the floor." And Mina's scenes of violence, rough enough by genre standards, feel more intense because she relates them from the victim's point of view. That's real guts for you.OBEDIENCE (Shaye Areheart/Crown, $24), a first novel by Will Lavender, is so slithery it ends up eating its own tail — which is not a bad thing for an academic mystery posing a puzzle so tricky that even the main characters wonder if the whole thing is a hoax. Don't expect any easy plot summary here, but it should help to know that the college students running around rural Indiana, trying to rescue a kidnapped girl in the six-week grace period before she's due to die, have been assigned their task in Logic and Reasoning 204. The creepy Professor Williams strongly hints that "Polly" is a real person and that her fate is indeed in their hands, but you can't help wondering why the college campus boasts a statue of Stanley Milgram, the behavioral psychologist who conducted infamous experiments in blind obedience when he taught at Yale in the 1960s.Authentic puzzle mysteries are an endangered species in these hectic times, so it's a genuine, if slightly perverse, kick to follow every byzantine clue in this bizarre game. Yes, the characterizations are thin, and yes, there are times when you want to yell, "Hey, kids — if X is so, and Y is also so, then. ..." But the author always jumps in to cast doubt on some initial premise in the mental equation. If you solve this one without peeking at the last chapter, it's an automatic A.We're so accustomed to finding Victorian-era mysteries set in gaslight London (or, if we're lucky, gloomier Edinburgh) that the initial surprise of THE ANATOMY OF DECEPTION (Delacorte, $24), a first novel by Lawrence Goldstone, is its Philadelphia locale. Although members of high society figure in the plot, this is no refined mystery of manners. Rather, it's a grimly faithful account of the state of medical research in the late 1800s. As seen through the eyes of a young doctor studying under William Osler, a real-life pioneer in modern medicine, the anatomy room of the Blockley Dead House is the most exciting place in the city — until a more sophisticated student introduces him to the delights and dangers on the shady side of town. Vivid period setting and amazing medical detail duly noted, if Goldstone's hero were any more naïve he'd be institutionalized.Robert B. Parker's crime novels about Jesse Stone, the chief of police in Paradise, Mass., never really hit their stride until Crow came to town. A hired killer whose real name is Wilson Cromartie and whose Apache ancestry seems dubious, Crow returns in STRANGER IN PARADISE (Putnam's, $25.95), a story about the usual small-town troubles that's involving without being exciting. But who cares, as long as it teams up two action heroes who were born to fight on the same side. Crow is Hawk, the enforcer in Parker's better-known Spenser series, before he was housebroken — which allows Jesse to be Spenser, before he got old. Jesse and Crow take target practice together ("We're good. ... "We are") and discuss their careers ("No point being a warrior if you can't find a war"). But mainly they talk the guy talk that is music to our ears.
