An announcer hailed Aretha Franklin as the Empress of Music at Radio City Music Hall on Saturday night before reverting to her usual title, the Queen of Soul. Then the large assemblage of musicians wrapped up the opening medley and started into "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher." And out came Ms. Franklin, moving at a processional pace, in an abundance of glitter and black chiffon. It was a manifest vision of music royalty, whatever sobriquet you choose.Like any sovereign Ms. Franklin has her pride. She adopted the empress moniker after publicly taking umbrage after this year's Grammy Awards ceremony (specifically, the part where Beyoncé saluted Tina Turner as "the Queen"). But indignation is the least intriguing thing about her new title, which forsakes the specificity of genre. Ms. Franklin really does have designs on an empire, as the concert intermittently proved.The second song was "My Funny Valentine," by Rodgers and Hart. She sang it in a stately cadence over a simmering groove, with plenty of drawn-out vowels and some stuttering hard consonants. Later she figure-skated through "Moody's Mood for Love," another ballad with a jazz history, in a way that felt more faithful than fanciful.Of course she sang "Respect." But it came so early that it seemed humbled, as if Ms. Franklin had a point to make about the rightful place of a singer in relation to a song. And immediately after the closing note, she enlisted her band conductor, H. B. Barnum, to fix a problem with her shoes. (To do so, he had to kneel at her feet.)Ms. Franklin then welcomed Ali-Ollie Woodson, formerly the lead singer of the Temptations, to join her for a plaintive slow jam: Keyshia Cole's "I Remember," currently the No. 1 single on Billboard's R&B/hip-hop chart. Ms. Franklin gave Mr. Woodson the bridge, the song's lyrical and musical peak. This didn't seem like avoidance of responsibility; it was generosity, and delegation.Those motives, among others, probably drove Ms. Franklin to what she called her next surprise: an interlude featuring her son Kecalf Cunningham, a Christian rapper, who came with a backpack, a hoodie and some cheap-sounding recorded tracks. After what felt like ages, it was a relief to have Ms. Franklin return, energies renewed, to belt out "Chain of Fools."There were a few other soul throwbacks in the concert, but its greater substance was gospel music. On "Precious Memories," which involved a powerful blend of several background singers, and "Ain't No Way," which featured Cissy Houston (though not in her original soprano role), Ms. Franklin sang with conviction, gravity and fire. It was here that her voice sounded most miraculous, and here that she dug in deepest with the band.Ms. Franklin made a point of acknowledging not only her birthday — she turns 66 on Tuesday — but also Easter. For an encore she sat at the piano and offered a serene rendition of the Irving Berlin song "Easter Parade." It was hardly the classic that her fans were clamoring for, but it was appropriate. And it was what had been decreed.UNIONDALE, N.Y. — Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige are worlds apart in their songs. He's a calmly assured mogul whose every past hustle has paid off. She's a wounded, needy, much betrayed woman whose old pain is close to the surface, and who has to keep reminding herself that now she's O.K. Onstage he's nonchalantly skillful, while she works herself into sweaty, disheveled, riveting turmoil. But they have collaborated on each other's songs, and now they are sharing the Heart of the City tour, which came to Nassau Coliseum here on Thursday night and reaches Madison Square Garden May 2, 6 and 7.In an efficient two-and-a-half-hour production, Jay-Z and Ms. Blige use one stage set (with different bands), start and end the show together, do cameos with each other and praise each other in video clips; Jay-Z follows Ms. Blige with no intermission. For both, the back story is one of struggle capped by success. But for Jay-Z the success is up front; for Ms. Blige the struggles are. She makes them passionately vivid.Her set started with professions of unlimited love: midtempo R&B songs that dissolved into lithe scat singing and wordless oohs and ahhs. When ecstasy was replaced by discord, she had all the words she needed: in "Stay Down," a plea and a vow to make it through a rough patch in a marriage; in "Fade Away," where she realizes she has been betrayed; in "No More Drama," where she decides to break up; and in "Your Child," where she discovers that her man has fathered another woman's baby. The songs built slowly with anger, ache, tearfulness and fury, with sustained notes and cascading melismas. Her face was contorted, and sometimes she raised a shaking fist.The musicality never wavered, and Ms. Blige's performances were cathartic: the deepest soul, private torment at arena scale. Then, having worked through the traumas, Ms. Blige proffered advice — the self-esteem counsel of "Work That" and "Just Fine" — and she was dancing again.Jay-Z's set was a high achiever's victory celebration. At one point Jay-Z moved alongside his disc jockey to spin his old tracks. Audience members immediately started rapping along, expecting him to step in, but he stopped each one short — more than a dozen — as a hitmaker with material to burn. He also did a string of songs based on his own nicknames: Jigga and Hova.Jay-Z presented his inner-city credentials with photographs of the Marcy Houses project in Brooklyn, where he grew up, as he rapped his reminiscences in "No Hook," and the rapper Memphis Bleek joined him on "U Know," about the cocaine trade. But the present — wealth, fame, a few regrets about women but not enough to stop the party — was more on his mind.For "Public Service Announcement" the video screen showed assorted presidents, and Jay-Z encouraged the crowd to curse George W. Bush. Then he rapped unaccompanied about his sympathy for soldiers at war and endorsed Barack Obama, taking care to say that Mr. Obama was not sponsoring or endorsing him.A large band replaced the sampled beats of Jay-Z's hits, dipping into hard rock, reggae and Latin rhythms. It wasn't always an improvement. Perhaps to challenge himself, he had the drummer playing so busily that the percussion collided with the rapid-fire syncopation of his rhymes.Jay-Z aims for variety, setting different meters for nearly every one of his raps, but in concert his virtuosity was just one more thing he took for granted. When Ms. Blige joined him to sing the hook on the finale — "Heart of the City," of course — it was her voice that put the longing into the song.Where do music genres go when they age? To the groves of academe. And so hip-hop, hugging 30, sits confidently alongside jazz and rock 'n' roll in the academy, subject of college courses and scholarly scrutiny. It's been a navel-gazing genre from the get-go, chronicled and dissected since its childhood in the 1980s. But in recent years, as the hip-hop-history industry has thrived like never before, highbrow words spent on the culture have seemed as copious as the platinum on P. Diddy's wrist.Perhaps that's because writing about hip-hop affords critics and scholars an opportunity to cast a wide net; this self-consciously capitalist genre is American culture writ large — a brasher, bolder, ruder edition of the Horatio Alger myth. Reading it as part and parcel of American social and political history is a way of legitimizing a culture long derided, and the bar for this brand of analysis was set high by Jeff Chang's "Can't Stop Won't Stop" (2005), a definitive history of the hip-hop generation. Close on Chang's heels (and treading many of his paths) comes the journalist Marcus Reeves with a sweeping, painstakingly thorough, not especially original history of hip-hop, told through the stories of a dozen celebrated acts and their sociopolitical contexts."Somebody Scream! Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power" is eminently readable and occasionally riveting. Its selection of artists is sound yet predictable. (Instead of scrutinizing the usual suspects — Tupac Shakur, the Notorious B.I.G., et al. — why not explore major stars over whom fewer gallons of erudite ink have been spilled?) The book, which ends with Eminem, begins in 1971, when black power was "crumbling" in real life but was reborn on television. The debut of "Soul Train," Reeves argues, "provided a national stage for black urban youth culture," thus sowing the seeds for hip-hop culture: "a hard-rock vessel carrying the hopes, anger, disappointments, attitude and history of post-black-power America."Hip-hop histories always have the same trajectory: from rags to riches, from America's bastard child to, as Reeves puts it, "America's new rock 'n' roll." This trajectory allows writers to wax nostalgic about "back in the day," when hip-hop was humble, all the while smirking over how far their baby has come. Reeves also does this, so his book sometimes reads like a litany of ever-escalating hip-hop "firsts" — first commercial single (the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight"); first album ("Kurtis Blow"); first double album (Tupac's "All Eyez on Me"); first act with a sneaker endorsement deal (Run-D.M.C., with Adidas); first Grammy winners (D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince); first Saturday-morning cartoon (M.C. Hammer's "Hammerman"). Here, too, are less triumphant firsts: first federal court to find an album obscene (Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, ruling on 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" in 1990); first Imus-esque controversy over rap lyrics (Tipper Gore versus Russell Simmons, in the mid-'80s) — affirming that all current debates about hip-hop and America's youth are recycled.Reeves loves context. His meticulous historicizing works in the case of hip-hop's well-documented inception during the mid-'70s: poverty and urban decay in places like the Bronx produced "an environment that had become comparable to the one in 'Lord of the Flies,' where children stranded on an island with no adult guidance create a new, brutal social order of their own." Hip-hop was therapy, after-school program and part-time job rolled into one. Reeves's historicizing works, too, in the case of gangsta rap, a product of Reagan's America: the cutting of social welfare programs led to steep inclines in black poverty rates, which led to crack, thriving gang economies — and N.W.A., superstar gangsta rappers straight outta Compton. So the rawest hip-hop became the most commercial: "Words and street jargon usually reserved for the corner or barbershops or neighborhood bars or tenement hallways — tucked in cozy spaces within black life — had a pop soundtrack and hit parade."But Reeves might keep in mind that correlation is not causation — or even relation. Take Jay-Z: in the days before having your own clothing line and record label was de rigueur for a rapper, this Brooklyn-born M.C. and entrepreneur indeed represented "the changing face of the corporate/cultural paradigm." But does he really have anything to do with the slavery reparations movement? Likewise, it's insulting to 9/11 victims and Amadou Diallo to read about them in light of the rapper DMX. Is his club single "Party Up" ("Y'all gonna make me lose my mind up in here — up in here!") really "a universal anthem for anyone young or old who was fed up with ignorance or ill treatment"? Sometimes a hot beat is just a hot beat.Ultimately, Reeves deserves credit for breadth, though sometimes it's at the expense of depth. Among the rich issues that go unexplored is the one alluded to in his subtitle, which implies that hip-hop reverberates with echoes of the black power movement. This is a contentious claim. Is hip-hop a torchbearer of civil rights or black power — and should it be? "Woe be it unto a community that has to rely on rappers for political leadership," the pioneering producer Bill Stephney stated in a 1987 Howard University forum. What is the criterion by which a rapper "has risen to his leadership? He can flow?" A question worthy of a book in itself.Since 1993 Itzhak Perlman and his wife, Toby, have coached a parade of superb young chamber players in what began as a summer music school and now runs through the year. The public face of the Perlman Music Program is a series of concerts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.In the installment on Saturday evening Mr. Perlman played first violin in Mendelssohn's String Quintet in B flat (Op. 87) and Brahms's Piano Quintet in F minor (Op. 34). Between those works, the LK String Quartet, a group formed at Mr. Perlman's summer school in 2002, gave a rugged account of Bartok's Quartet No. 3.The most immediately striking element of the Mendelssohn performance was not the music making, polished as it was, but the ensemble's body language. Even taking into account that gestures are easily (and too often) falsified, especially among young musicians, these players attentively watched for cues from Mr. Perlman and one another and seemed genuinely engaged in the give and take. The performance illuminated the richness of Mendelssohn's melodic imagination and had the fluidity and zest you expect from musicians who react to one another rather than merely play their lines.The LK String Quartet's light-textured, transparent reading of the Bartok was unusual, but it wasn't as if these players turned the music into Lehar. Passages that demanded a harsh edge received it,  and in its best moments the performance was fiery and propulsive, with striking unanimity in the quickly shifting dynamics of the final pages.The Brahms performance shared many of the attributes of the Mendelssohn, with Orion Weiss's appealing account of the piano line, the sweet-toned tandem violin playing of Mr. Perlman and Sharon Roffman and the richly textured sounds of Jessica Oudin's viola and Yves Dharamraj's cello all contributing amply to the sense of Brahmsian warmth.The other performers were Michelle Ross, violinist; Megan Griffin, violist; and Jia Kim, cellist, in the Mendelssohn, and Sean Lee and Kristin Lee, violinists; Laura Seay, violist; and Jordan Han, cellist, in the Bartok.Jury and audience members sometimes differ on who merits first prize in music competitions. The 26-year-old German pianist Benjamin Moser won the audience favorite prize at last year's International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, but  placed fifth in the official lineup. That year he also won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions, and the organization presented him in his New York recital debut on Tuesday at Zankel Hall, part of the Young Concert Artists Series.Mr. Moser, who also won the award for best interpretation of a work by Tchaikovsky in Moscow, seemed in his element playing "October" and "January" from Tchaikovsky's "Seasons," a warmly intimate work written soon after the thunderous piano concerto.His technique and musicality were shown to fine effect in Scriabin's Chopinesque "Two Pieces for the Left Hand," in which Scriabin, who had injured his right hand, gives both melody and accompaniment to the left one. In Mr. Moser's eloquent performance it seemed as if two hands were playing. Both of them flew across the keys in his passionate, colorful rendition of the composer's tumultuous Fantasy in B minor (Op. 28).The program also included "Elis: Three Night Pieces" by Heinz Holliger,  primarily known as a superb oboist. Written in 1961 when he was studying composition with Pierre Boulez, the work takes its inspiration from the writings of the symbolist poet Georg Trakl, who committed suicide in 1914 at age 27. Trakl based many of his poems on Elis Froebom, a 17th-century Swedish miner who died in a mine on his wedding day.  Mr. Moser gracefully played the three short abstract movements, which at times reflect the influence of Berg and Schoenberg.The first half of the program was significantly less memorable. Perhaps because of nerves, Mr. Moser seemed stiff while playing four preludes and an étude tableau by Rachmaninoff and Ravel's "Gaspard de la Nuit," which were competently performed but rather bland, mostly lacking an expressive spark.For encores, Mr. Moser, who was certainly an audience favorite on Tuesday, offered a fiery, virtuosic rendition  —  notable for its crystalline articulation and driving momentum   —  of the third movement from Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 7 and a whimsical interpretation of the first movement of Schumann's "Kinderszenen."ChappaquaIN January, Emily A. Tabin, executive director of the Westchester Jazz Orchestra, and Mike Holober, its artistic director, sat in Ms. Tabin's living room here  inserting more than 300 copies of the group's  first CD, "All In,"  into envelopes addressed to jazz radio stations across the country. While they expected the CD to be played, they never anticipated the degree of its success. Within two weeks, "All In" was No. 37 on the JazzWeek airplay chart, a weekly report of the top 50 jazz recordings played on radio stations in the United States and Canada. By March 10, it had hit No. 4.The reception of "All In" is a reflection of the Westchester Jazz Orchestra's growth, both musical and organizational, since its inception five years ago. It took that time, said Ms. Tabin, 51, for the orchestra "to arrive at a certain level of performance, to develop a strong enough repertoire and to have the financial ability to record.""We have evolved from an orchestra that sounded really good and had great potential to one that is beginning to fulfill that potential," she said.Gary B. Walker, the music director and host of "Morning Jazz" at WBGO, the  Newark jazz station, said the  five years before the band made its initial recording were a blessing. "This is a group of individuals that has gelled as an orchestra beyond their wildest dreams," he said. Mr. Walker, 58, has been the host for  nearly all of the orchestra's concerts, and wrote the liner notes for "All In." He said the CD's placement on the JazzWeek chart was "unusual for a jazz orchestra.""To have a virtually unknown organization come out and catch the attention of so many radio programmers says something about the music they play," he said.That music includes arrangements of jazz standards by composers like John Coltrane and Joe Henderson, as well as George Harrison's "Here Comes the Sun." The CD's selections parallel the orchestra's eclectic catalog, which encompasses what Mr. Walker describes as "rearrangements of jazz evergreens," along with Motown, Beatles songs and other popular compositions.Mr. Holober, 50, a conductor, arranger and pianist who has taught at the City College of New York for 25 years, took the post of artistic director in January 2007 after several guest performances with the orchestra. Recording "All In," he said, "was a way of documenting our sound.""If you do five concerts a year, you essentially exist for only those 10 hours," he said. "Once you are recorded, you can be played and replayed. You have a life on the radio, the Internet and in people's homes and cars."Both Ms. Tabin and Mr. Walker cite Mr. Holober's leadership as critical to the orchestra's recent accomplishments. "He has his own vision, but he is also able to accept input from the others," Ms. Tabin said. "He has the ability to bring out the best in everyone."Mr. Holober said  the recent formation of an advisory board  would "lend further credibility to our efforts." The board now has seven members, including Mr. Walker and several award-winning musicians, like the trumpeter and flugelhorn player Randy Brecker; the tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano; and, from Croton Falls,  the tenor saxophonist Houston Person.In addition to Ms. Tabin and Mr. Holober, the orchestra has  16 veteran musicians who range in age from 30 to 68. Most of the band members  either live or teach in Westchester. Ms. Tabin said the impetus to assemble the orchestra was "to showcase the many amazing jazz artists and to serve the thousands of jazz fans here."Looking forward, Ms. Tabin said the orchestra is discussing a second CD and continuing its educational outreach with workshops in local schools, including two in Harrison in April. On April 12, it will present "The Music of Gershwin and Simon," with Kate McGarry, guest vocalist and Tarrytown resident. The performance, to be held at Irvington Town Hall, was inspired by Paul Simon's recent receipt of the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Award. The season's final concert, on June 7, features Brazilian jazz, with a guest percussionist, Rogerio Boccato of Yonkers.
