R. KELLY"Double Up"(Jive/Zomba)"Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B." So singeth R. Kelly, near the end of his thumping, piano-driven hit, "I'm a Flirt (Remix)," which just might be the most pleasurable song on the radio. It's an unnecessary boast: Who could possibly argue, or forget?Five years ago a sex scandal threatened to dethrone him, but in the end it merely gave him more of what every star needs: attention and motivation. A double-entendriffic comeback hit, "Ignition (Remix)," marked his return in 2003; since then he has affirmed his position as one of the era's greatest and weirdest pop stars. He still faces 14 counts of child pornography, stemming from a widely circulated video that allegedly shows him with an under-age girl.  (The trial hasn't begun.) But you'd never guess it from "Double Up," which might be the most cocksure album of his career.Bragging and cursing and reeling off rapid-fire lyrics, Mr. Kelly acts as if he's the king of hip-hop too. Rapper collaborators (including Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Chamillionaire and T. I.) inevitably get upstaged by a charismatic host who barely even bothers to make his sung-rhymes rhyme. With its  dirty-South beat and big-money lyrics, "Rollin' " could have been a rote club track; instead the playful and unpredictable vocal line makes it a minor tour de force.Mr. Kelly loves a good story, which he proved in 2005 with his 12-part R&B musical, "Trapped in the Closet." (The 10-part sequel is due in July.) Most of the best songs on "Double Up" are convoluted narratives: "Same Girl," with Usher, is a silly but elegant duet about two guys making an unhappy discovery ("Man, we been messing with the same girl"); "Best Friend," with Keyshia Cole and Polow Da Don, finds our hero in jail, trying to figure out if his girlfriend is helping him or two-timing him (or both); "Real Talk" is a scary, vivid monologue delivered by an aggrieved boyfriend.Sometimes Mr. Kelly's peculiarities get predictable: "The Zoo," "Sweet Tooth" and "Sex Planet" could be differently themed versions of the same make-out song. This is a nutty album, but a pretty single-minded one, which explains why the inspirational ode "Rise Up" (dedicated to victims of the Virginia Tech shootings) sounds so incongruous. Forget the high road: the true heart of "Double Up" is "Leave Your Name," a smoothed-out voice mail message explaining that Mr. Kelly can't come to the phone because he's still drunk from the night before. He'll sober up soon enough, but for now he's on a singularly entertaining bender. KELEFA SANNEHTHE BRAVERY"The Sun and the Moon" (Island)"Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear/Every thought in your head is like poison to hear," sings Sam Endicott, the Bravery's songwriter, on this band's second album, "The Sun and the Moon." What really matters is what he sings immediately afterward: "Oh, oh oh oh-oh-ohhh/Oh, oh oh oh-oh-ohh." Because for all the angst in the Bravery's latest songs, the hooks come first. The Bravery is a pop-rock band and glad of it. That means plenty of nonsense syllables to invite singalongs, and utter shamelessness about borrowing other bands' sounds and tricks.The Bravery is from New York, and while its self-titled 2005 debut album was fixated on 1980's British new wave — especially the yelpy singing of the Cure's Robert Smith — "The Sun and the Moon" goes trans-Atlantic. Duran Duran, the Beatles and the Clash now help feed the Bravery's British tastes, but the band has also picked up the mournful sympathy of Elliott Smith in "Tragedy Bound" and the exuberant vocal counterpoint of the Turtles and the Beach Boys in "Angelina," even as Mr. Endicott sings lines like, "Everything I have someday will fall apart and fade away."It's a strategic move. The new-wave revival was already peaking when the Bravery released its debut album, and another extended hommage to the Cure would have been a blunder. By trading retro preciousness for craftsmanlike pride, the Bravery has grown no less blatant, but, somehow, more likeable. JON PARELESRICHARD THOMPSON"Sweet Warrior" (Shout! Factory)"Dad's Gonna Kill Me" is the bleakest song on Richard Thompson's new album, "Sweet Warrior." Dad is Baghdad, and the song, filled with military slang Mr. Thompson found online, details the thoughts of a soldier stationed there, watching his comrades die: "Vultures pecking the eyes out of his head/Another day that could have been me there instead/Nobody loves me here."Mr. Thompson has always had a pessimistic, death-haunted view of humanity, and contemplating the war hasn't leavened it any. Through a modest but magnificent career that stretches through countless songs and four decades — back to Fairport Convention in the 1960s — Mr. Thompson has melded the rigorous beauty of the Celtic folk tradition with his own unsparing eye and ear."Sweet Warrior" spins stories of some typical Thompson characters — unstable cads ("Bad Monkey"), cheating lovers ("He believes in chastity,  for some"), spiteful exes ("I'd say our time has all but disappeared/Just like the shine on your fabulous career") — and some unusual ones (a gang stool pigeon in "Sneaky Boy" and an I.R.A. bomber in "Guns Are the Tongues"). There's also unadorned grief and tenderness in "Poppy-Red," "She Sang Angels to Rest" and "Take Care the Road You Choose."The music has been honed to essentials as Mr. Thompson finds the Celtic threads in ballads, 1950s-flavored rock, reggae, country and foreboding modal drones. His previous album of his own songs, "Front Parlour Ballads," stuck to acoustic instruments; "Sweet Warrior" restores all the possibilities of his electric guitars, from steely architectural underpinnings to solos that can be as compassionate or biting as his words. Even when Mr. Thompson uses his caustic wit for laughs, the songs on "Sweet Warrior" hold a tension and vehemence that make their bitterness linger. JON PARELESVON SüDENFED"Tromatic Reflexxions" (Domino)Mark E. Smith, the singer of the British postpunk band the Fall, has legitimized his catarrhal snarl, his malignant susurrations, by running a band for 30 years in the image of his voice, one that plays broken-spoke repetitions with musical imperfection. The sound of the Fall, taken as a career average over its many lineups, is organic, real, even squalid (in the best way). Why would we want to hear him in a different band with metronome-beat electronics? After all he's too good as a mode of resistance against machines.But good art falls outside the laws of logic. This complex record that Mr. Smith has made with two members of the German electronic group Mouse on Mars, Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner, is better than passable. (As a trio they call themselves Von Südenfed.) The album is brilliant on its own terms: a party record with no fixed strategy, one that wiggles out of all responsibilities to the partier.Mr. Smith is like a great gutbucket improviser with his flat Manchester whine. No one has ever pronounced "can't get enough" quite like that: roughly, "ken gedenowuhhh."He has rhythmic authority when he wants to, though sometimes he's rhythmless. (His voice, on this album, is digitally processed here and there,  but just a little.) All over "Tromatic Reflexxions" (out now in Europe; to be released in the United States on June 5) you also hear unmoored ephemera, neologisms, stories with no endings, pronouns with no referents, impossible commands. Mr. Smith is paradoxical, down to his tone: If there could be such a thing as a stentorian mumble, he has it.Mouse on Mars doesn't like to be monolithic, either. One song here is four-on-the-floor electro-rock ("The Rhinohead"); another has the hyperbass depth and two-step rhythm of recent British club music ("Flooded"); others come out of early 1980s electronic minimalism. And then, bafflingly, there are tracks with live drums, or nothing but voice and strummed acoustic guitar, or an approximation of Nigerian juju. "Jbak Lois Lane" is a field recording of a quarrel between Mr. Smith and what sounds like a man on a riding lawnmower. "Where's your boss?" demands Mr. Smith, sounding unreasonable, before the roar of the engine and some abstract guitar sounds rise up together in the mix. BEN RATLIFFCHICK COREA AND BéLA FLECK"The Enchantment" (Concord)The notes fly fast and in tight formation on "The Enchantment," a duet album by the pianist Chick Corea and the banjoist Béla Fleck. That shouldn't be a surprise, given the histories of these virtuosos. Both are dazzling improvisers with effusive tendencies, and both could reasonably be called percussionists at heart. So this easily could have been a messy riot of an album, with too much happening at once. But for the most part it isn't because there's so much focused listening going on and — just as crucially — because both artists are such eager omnivores. Jazz is to Mr. Corea as  bluegrass is to Mr. Fleck: a formative discipline and an ongoing fascination, but hardly the whole story. They actually have a lot in common stylistically, including an overstimulated brand of fusion that thankfully makes no incursions here.Instead there are evocative servings of Spanish flamenco, Argentine tango and Appalachian balladry, along with modal jazz and chamber music. "Brazil," the Ary Barroso-Bob Russell classic, makes a welcome appearance; otherwise the program consists of originals, four by Mr. Corea and six by Mr. Fleck.Not all of them work — Mr. Fleck's "Strange Romance" belabors its rococo sensibility, and Mr. Corea's "Children's Song No. 6" sits a bit uneasily,  but the successes are plentiful. "Mountain," by Mr. Fleck, capitalizes on the modality of bluegrass, flattering both players. "Joban Dna Nopia," by Mr. Corea, presents a provocative chord progression, a loping 12/8 swing feel and a good opportunity for instrumental contrast.And then there's "Menagerie," an urgent rumba that recalls something from Mr. Corea's extensive forays into flamenco. Mr. Fleck composed the tune, and he plays it magnificently. If it's not an hommage to his duet partner, it could surely double as one. NATE CHINENPERRY FARRELL'S SATELLITE PARTY"Ultra Payloaded" (Columbia)No, Perry Farrell's high voice doesn't change suddenly for "Woman in the Window," the last song on "Ultra Payloaded" That song's familiar baritone belongs to Jim Morrison of the Doors, singing a previously unreleased vocal track with mysterious, quasi-biblical lyrics. Mr. Farrell's newly devised accompaniment starts as chill-out music and builds with strings and Beatles allusions while Morrison croons, "Just try and stop us, we're going to love."When he led Jane's Addiction in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr. Farrell was a figure like Morrison: mingling pleasure with danger, singing about love, death and Oedipal struggle (and, in Jane's Addiction, drugs and shoplifting).Mr. Farrell has gone on to be more ringmaster than freak as the founder of the Lollapalooza festival, while his musical projects have moved from a rock band, Porno for Pyros, to clubland electronica. With his new band, Satellite Party, purely benevolent bliss comes first: "It's time to shine and make all your dreams come true," Mr. Farrell announces as the album begins.Every so often Mr. Farrell hints at deeper social significance, as he does in his collaboration with Thievery Corporation, "The Solutionists": "The paradox of poverty has left us dismayed/Sliding democracies washing away." But from a virtual remake of Rare Earth's "I Just Want to Celebrate" (titled "Only Love, Let's Celebrate") to the album's title song, Mr. Farrell's Satellite Party is mostly devoted to a good time.With Nuno Bettencourt (from Extreme) playing many of the guitars and keyboards, Satellite Party's catchy, upbeat songs riffle through Mr. Farrell's favorite grooves: echo-laden Eastern-tinged psychedelia, pulsating new wave, reggae, sinewy punk and especially wah-wah-happy, string-topped 1970s funk, seguing into one another like one of Mr. Farrell's D.J. sets. He's still trying to loosen people up — "Whatever's in your closet, set it free," he urges in "Kinky" — but there's nothing dark or scary about it, just the old countercultural creed that fun is revolutionary. Mr. Farrell has become the happy hippie that Jim Morrison never was. JON PARELESSeveral years ago a group billed as the Mark Turner-Ethan Iverson Quartet made an auspicious debut at the Village Vanguard, with Mr. Turner on tenor saxophone, Mr. Iverson on piano, Ben Street on bass and Billy Hart on drums. This week the same ensemble is back at the Vanguard with a different handle, the Billy Hart Quartet, and a clearer sense of itself, judging by a potent and well-balanced first set on Tuesday night.Bebop is the group's lingua franca, though it should be understood that the word refers here to an aesthetic practice rather than a historical style. Mr. Hart, who is 66, has covered the full jazz spectrum during his accomplished career; he isn't a classicist or a throwback. His younger band mates demonstrate a grasp of modern traditions but also a strong aversion to nostalgia. The whole enterprise functions in the present tense.And Mr. Hart is the leader for reasons other than seniority or courtesy. He has a loose but authoritative approach to propulsion, along with an almost scary conviction in the power of a single emphatic gesture: the thwack of a mallet on a floor tom, the washy impact of a full-tilt cymbal crash. He also contributed the most memorable tunes, melodically speaking, in Tuesday's set. Even more  than on the group's sterling recent album, "Quartet" (High Note), Mr. Hart sounded altogether like the man in charge.The other members of the group exerted an equal pull. Mr. Turner was the primary soloist, and his distinctive style — heavy on arpeggios and scalar elaborations — was a prominent feature of the set. He ended "Moment's Notice," the John Coltrane classic, with a cadenza that gradually spiraled outward, practically ghostwriting an alternate composition. Elsewhere in the set, notably on Mr. Iverson's stark blues "Mellow B," Mr. Turner played a stream of 16th notes in his altissimo range, only occasionally tossing in a triplet run or landing on a long tone in his braying low register.Mr. Iverson adopted a drier and less effusive approach. He sounded best on "Charvez," a ballad by Mr. Hart with a recurring two-chord flourish; the song's inherent drama suited Mr. Iverson's declaratory instincts, and its modal progression prompted him to explore an insistent polytonality. On the more boppish material, he showed signs of Bud Powell's influence, but with a chromatic tendency informed by the postwar avant-garde.Mr. Street had his standout solo on "Irah," a near-ballad by Mr. Hart. He started simply, playing quarter notes in a pedal drone. Then he developed a sequence of ideas with patience and restraint. He stayed within reach of the melody, often brushing against it but also implying some modest harmonic variations.There is tension in the ensemble's rhythmic relationship to swing, which Mr. Hart embraces more wholeheartedly than his colleagues. But it doesn't pose a real problem — Mr. Hart could swing hard enough to pull the entire band, if he needed to — and in some ways the friction distinguishes this ensemble from countless others covering similar post-bop terrain.A year ago the Ukrainian pianist Konstantin Lifschitz made a powerful impression on a Town Hall audience with a complete traversal of Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues, presented in afternoon and evening installments. How to top that feat? If you're Mr. Lifschitz, you turn to Shostakovich's inspiration, Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," as he did in a Sunday double-header that concluded the Free for All at Town Hall season.Mr. Lifschitz has long been associated with Bach's music; still, taking on "The Well-Tempered Clavier" is no small thing. The work comprises two books of 24 preludes and fugues each: one completed in Cöthen in 1722, the other in Leipzig in 1744. Each starts with a prelude and a fugue in C and ascends the scale by half-steps to a concluding pair in B minor.Traversals of one book or the other in a single sitting are not uncommon. But Mr. Lifschitz, whose program note characterized the First Book as "songs of innocence" and the Second as "songs of experience," interleaved them so that the Prelude and Fugue in C from the First was followed by the corresponding pair from the Second, and so on. The matinee program combined the first 12 preludes and fugues from both books; the remainder were played in the evening. Each concert drew well, with a fair number of audience members attending both.Playing from memory, Mr. Lifschitz revealed how thoroughly he had internalized the notes, contours and character of each piece. In matters of tempo, balance, articulation and pedaling, every choice he made served the music. Yet so naturally poetic and expressive was his playing that he made it seem as if the entirety of the modern piano repertory lay nascent in these 48 pieces.Even amid such sustained excellence, highlights emerged. The C minor Prelude from Book 1 and the G sharp minor Prelude from Book 2 showed off Mr. Lifschitz's technical prowess in lines that raced at breakneck speed. But his playing was still more gripping at the opposite extreme. Mr. Lifschitz played the E flat minor Prelude from Book 1 with breathtaking fragility; the fugue that followed opened at the cusp of inaudibility, arresting daydreamers and refocusing their attention.Even after so arduous a trek, Mr. Lifschitz graciously provided an appreciative evening audience with two encores: a repeat of the opening Prelude in C, and the Sarabande from the French Suite No. 5.BOSTONTHE only waiting  people do in Boston is for a slow Internet connection. So when the Beehive opened a week and a half ago  — without fanfare or advertising — and a line stretched out the door every night, people were anxious to know how long the wait was. Even if they weren't entirely sure what they were waiting for."It's a restaurant?" Nicole Black, 31, said to her companions when a manager announced that a table had become available for any party waiting to eat."I came because I know the band," said her friend Iyeoka Okoawo, 32, a spoken-word artist who was interested in checking out the performance area.Nestled in the Boston Center for the Arts complex, the Beehive's space dates from 1884 and was most recently occupied by a black-box theater at street level and a dilapidated basement. Now, a dining room on the upper level overlooks "the pit," where round cafe tables surround a slightly elevated stage. Live jazz, soul or R&B is featured nightly.The Beehive is the newest addition to the South End, where sleek lounges and white-linen restaurants have opened at a steady tempo over the past decade while dive bars have gone the way of the cassette tape.The Beehive draws a dinner crowd, but it also serves as a welcome night-life addition in a city where live music tends to come with a hefty cover charge and throngs of hipper-than-thou students."This place is oozing with soul," said Young Paik, 29, sipping Macallan at the upstairs bar. "You can hang out up here if you want to cool down."Local artists helped impart a bordello-meets-supper-club gritty opulence, with touches like stencil work on the walls, recycled wood for the bars and lush red curtains in the pit. Sparkly chandeliers hang from exposed pipes."I can't believe they made a bar out of a boiler room!" said Charles Fletcher, 35, an architect and interior designer. "It has such a bohemian attitude, which is much needed in Boston."The Beehive takes its name from the French, la ruche, which is also the name of the rotunda-style building in Montparnasse where artists like Chagall and Modigliani stayed when they were short on cash.But at this Beehive, artists and white-collar professionals commingle happily, especially when the music starts. The lack of a formal dance floor doesn't stop people from improvising."Shall we spin?" a burly man inquired of a petite blonde in a flowing red top. She grasped his extended hand and twirled accordingly.COMEDYHASBROUCK HEIGHTS Bananas Comedy Club John Pinette, stand-up. Friday and June 9. $25. Bananas Comedy Club, 283 Route 17 South.
