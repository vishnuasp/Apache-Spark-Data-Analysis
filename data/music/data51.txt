CLASSICALFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.LEIF OVE ANDSNES There are some performers whose personalities or eccentricities become inseparable from their music making. Then there are musicians who reveal themselves only through music. The brilliant, unassuming Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, above, falls into this  category.Mr. Andsnes, 38, who grew up on an island off the west coast of Norway and won the prestigious Gilmore Artist Award in 1998, frequently demonstrates that he is a pianist of magisterial elegance, power and insight in repertory including Mozart, Schubert, Prokofiev and Bartok.On Thursday he brings an eclectic program to Carnegie Hall (part of a six-city solo recital American  tour) that will surely highlight those qualities. Central to the program is Grieg's Ballade in G minor (Op. 24). Written as 14 variations on a folk song theme, Grieg's largest-scale work for solo piano is notable for its chromatic harmonies, melancholy introspection, lyrical beauty and stormy outbursts.Mr. Andsnes only recently felt drawn to this dark, probing piece, which was composed, Grieg wrote, "with my life's blood in days of sorrow and despair," following the death of his parents. Legendary in Norway, the Ballade is seldom performed elsewhere. But Mr. Andsnes is bringing it out of the shadow of Grieg's ever-popular ebullient piano concerto, recording it for EMI Classics in honor of last year's centenary of the composer's death, along with the concerto and some of the Lyric Pieces.Mr. Andsnes will also highlight little-known piano works composed at different points during the career of Sibelius, another Scandinavian composer. The selections include "The Birch Tree" (Op. 74, No. 4) and "Elegiaco" (Op. 76, No. 10), both of which will receive their Carnegie Hall premieres.The program includes Bach's Toccata in E minor (BWV 914), Beethoven's Sonata No. 13 (Op. 27, No. 1) and selections from Debussy's Preludes, Books I and II. (Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to  $96.) VIVIEN SCHWEITZER Opera'BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Saturday and Wednesday) This Verdi favorite returns with Angela M. Brown as Amelia and Stephanie Blythe as Ulrica. Salvatore Licitra and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are Riccardo and Renato. Saturday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $220 on Saturday; sold out on Wednesday.(Bernard Holland)'LA BOHÈME' (Friday) Franco Zeffirelli's busy 1981 production returns, offering audiences ample opportunity to watch both the principals and the army of choristers and extras engaging in the pointless gesturing and aimless loping about that passes for acting in an opera house. The cast includes Angela Gheorghiu as a supple Mimi; Ramón Vargas as a warm-toned, if restrained, Rodolfo; and Ainhoa Arteta as a colorful, flamboyant Musetta. Nicola Luisotti conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Allan Kozinn)'CANDIDE' (Friday through Sunday) This 1982 Harold Prince staging may not be the best of all possible "Candide" productions, but then no one has ever agreed on what is. And given the work's history of revisions, reorchestrations, cuts, restorations and additions, the possibilities are numerous. For a listener in the mood for a frenetic, comic-book staging, this one makes a diverting evening, and of course the charms of Mr. Bernstein's tuneful score are not to be underestimated. The City Opera is presenting it nightly, with Daniel Reichard in the title role. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Kozinn)'LA FANCIULLA DEL WEST' (Friday and Sunday) Many Puccini connoisseurs consider "La Fanciulla del West" one of the composer's most sophisticated scores. Perhaps the reason this engaging work, a prototype for spaghetti western films, is not heard more often is that its leading roles are so difficult. The brave Dicapo Opera Theater tackles "Fanciulla," set in California during the gold rush, in a production by Michael Capasso. Irina Rindzuner sings Minnie, the popular tavern owner, and Marcos Aguiar is the lovable bandit Ramerrez (alias Dick Johnson). It could be fun to experience the opera in the company's intimate, 200-seat theater. Friday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $55.(Anthony Tommasini)★ 'LA FILLE DU RÉGIMENT' (Monday) When Laurent Pelly's new production of Donizetti's frothy "Fille du Régiment" opened this winter at the Royal Opera in Covent Garden, The Times of London hailed it as the "operatic show of the season." This co-production with the Metropolitan Opera opens at that house on Monday, with the same starry leads from London: the soprano Natalie Dessay as Marie, an irrepressible tomboy who has been raised by an army regiment, and the tenor Juan Diego Flórez as Tonio, who has been trailing the regiment out of love for Marie. This production is already one of the hottest tickets of the Met's season. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)'OUR TOWN' (Wednesday) Few contemporary composers handle voices better than Ned Rorem, but his operas remain less well traveled than his songs. Perhaps "Our Town"  —  based on the Thornton Wilder play (you've probably seen the film, with Copland's score), with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy  —  will change that. The students of the Juilliard Opera Center perform in this production, directed by Edward Berkeley. Ann Manson conducts.   At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500,  juilliard.edu; $20. (Kozinn)★ 'SATYAGRAHA' (Saturday and Tuesday) Philip Glass's music will always divide audiences. But this 1980 opera, a mystical portrait of Mahatma Gandhi in his early years fighting for civil rights in South Africa, is both a seminal work of the Minimalist movement and a landmark achievement for Mr. Glass. The Metropolitan Opera's new production, a joint venture with the English National Opera, offers a hauntingly fanciful staging of a deeply spiritual work, deploying a roster of actors, aerialists and puppeteers. You are unlikely to hear a better musical performance. The excellent cast, led by the tenor Richard Croft as Gandhi, and the Met's brave chorus, give their all to the demanding music, with its lulling patterns of repetitive riffs and motifs. But you must enter a contemplative state to experience this visionary opera as intended. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $220. (Tommasini)Classical Music★ AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Friday) During the early years of the 20th century, when Italian opera composers could hardly keep pace with the public's demand for verismo melodramas, there was a concurrent modernist movement in the country, a "New Italian Renaissance," to quote the title of the conductor Leon Botstein's intriguing program on Friday with the American Symphony Orchestra. Malipiero and Casella were the best-known modernists of the group. Respighi and Martucci, though far more traditional, had a powerful champion in Toscanini. In a fitting blast from the late 19th century, the program begins with the "Triumphant March" from Verdi's "Aida." At  8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, americansymphony.org; $27 to $55. (Tommasini)GAIL ARCHER (Sunday) This excellent organist continues her celebration of the centenary of Olivier Messiaen's birth, performing his music in churches around the city. Here she performs his "Meditations on the Mystery of the Holy Trinity." At 3 p.m., Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, Lexington Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 744-2080, csvf.org; free.(Vivien Schweitzer)BARGEMUSIC (Friday through Sunday) Cullen Bryant, a pianist, and Emanuel Borok, a violinist, open the weekend's varied programming at Bargemusic, an intimate chamber hall in a converted coffee barge moored on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Friday's program includes Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's Sonata in Three Movements (1974) and works by Mozart, Mendelssohn, Strauss and Tchaikovsky. On Saturday Anton Dressler, a clarinetist, and John Novacek, a pianist, take over with a program of clarinet sonatas by Brahms, Poulenc, Bernstein, Alexander Tcherepnin and Efrem Podgaiz. The Sunday program is devoted to chamber works by Copland, Dvorak, Jindrich Feld, Frank Martin, Lowell Liebermann and Peteris Vasks, performed by the Clavier Trio and Ilze Urbane, a flutist. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+ on Friday; $20 for students. (Kozinn)BROOKLYN CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY (Friday) This group, a relatively recent addition to the local chamber music scene, offers high-profile performers in an intimate space. The program features the violinist Carmit Zori, the violist Robert Rinehart, the cellist Timothy Eddy and the pianist Gilbert Kalish playing Mozart's Duo for Violin and Viola in B flat major, Ravel's Trio in A minor and Brahms's Quartet for piano and strings in A. At 8 p.m., First Unitarian Church, 50 Monroe Place, at Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 858-0718, brooklynchambermusicsociety.org; $30; $20 for students. (Schweitzer)STEPHEN GOSLING AND ERIC HUEBNER (Tuesday) Stravinsky with one and two pianos, as well as the Concerto for Piano and Winds, are part of the Miller Theater's five-concert Stravinsky Festival, which for this concert  moves to Midtown Manhattan, to St. Bartholomew's Church. At 7:30 p.m., Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; sold out. (Holland)MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Friday) In a tradition that began in 1970, noteworthy past participants and recent up-and-coming alumni of this venerable school and festival collaborate for concerts at the Metropolitan Museum. This program includes the seasoned violist Kim Kashkashian and young performers like the violinist Yura Lee performing Mozart's Horn Quintet in E flat major, Britten's Quartet No. 2 and Dvorak's String Quintet in E flat major. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Schweitzer)NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) The conductor Charles Dutoit and the pianist Martha Argerich had plans to be together again, but Ms. Argerich, who has had health problems in recent years, withdrew a few days ago and will be replaced by André Watts. The programs — Mozart, Rachmaninoff and Ravel, with Mr. Watts as the soloist in Beethoven's First Piano Concerto  — will be unchanged. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out.  (Holland)ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Two Bach cantatas —  "Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ" and "Wachet Auf" — are presented at the Metropolitan Museum's Medieval Sculpture Hall. The singers are members of the Handel and Haydn Society Chorus. At 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50.  (Holland)★ VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Saturday) The Miller Theater's five-part Stravinsky festival, showcasing different facets of music by this groundbreaking composer,  includes  his sacred works. The Vox Vocal Ensemble and Gotham City Orchestra, led by George Steel, will perform the "Symphony of Psalms," Mass and "Requiem Canticles." At 7:30 p.m., Park Avenue Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street, (212) 228-8200, millertheater.com; $45. (Schweitzer)In some ways it was like any big night at 315 Bowery, where the grimy "CBGB & OMFUG" awning had hung for three decades.Loud guitars blared from within. A capacity crowd filled every nook and cranny inside the narrow space, and tattered rock 'n' roll posters looked down from the dark walls. Bob Gruen was even buzzing around with his camera, shooting pretty girls and rock stars.But on Thursday night it was clear from the tanned, cheek-kissing clientele and the whiff of expensive tequila that this was no  CBGB. It was a gala party and concert for an upscale new John Varvatos boutique that opened two weeks ago  in the space where CBGB stood from late 1973 until a real estate dispute forced it out 18 months ago.In a vivid example of the culture clashes of the new Bowery, in which the old zone of poverty and bohemianism is quickly being transformed into Manhattan's latest luxury district, Mr. Varvatos has created a slick simulacrum of the old club to help sell $250 shirts and $2,000 jackets.A section of wall from CBGB covered in band fliers has been preserved under glass, and in keeping with Mr. Varvatos's image as a rock 'n' roll designer — his models include Iggy Pop and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden — the store is decorated with rock memorabilia and also sells vintage vinyl records and audio equipment."The whole purpose of coming here was to retain part of the history," Mr. Varvatos said in an interview, as bands sound-checked before the show, "so that anybody can walk in off the street and experience part of what was here."The party, a benefit for the VH1 Save the Music Foundation, which supports music education, showed off Mr. Varvatos's connections with music celebrities. Among the performers who played on a temporary stage in back, where CBGB's stage had been, were Joan Jett, D Generation and Ronnie Spector. And around 1 a.m. Slash from Guns N' Roses, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction and Wayne Kramer of the MC5 played an electrifying set that included 1970s classics like the MC5's "Kick Out the Jams" and Thin Lizzy's "Jailbreak."The Varvatos shop is the latest high-priced arrival on the Bowery. New businesses include the Bowery Hotel up the street, where rooms begin at about $500 a night. But the long-term leaseholder for the shop's building is the Bowery Residents' Committee, a nonprofit organization that helps homeless people.Some CBGB regulars were there on Thursday in support of the store, like Dick Manitoba of the Dictators (who sang "Kick Out the Jams") and Arturo Vega, the longtime creative director of the Ramones, who showed up in a crisp white Varvatos shirt. (He said he paid for it.)But not everyone is happy about the new tenant. On the sidewalk outside a handful of protesters complained about the effects of gentrification on the city's music scene. Rebecca Moore, a musician who is one of the founders of Take It to the Bridge, an activist group that organized the demonstration, sparred loudly with Mr. Vega. Saying that Lower Manhattan is becoming "a playground for rich people," she shouted: "Forty-thousand-dollar-a-month rents, $1,600 jackets and $800 pants are closing music spaces in New York."Smiling, Mr. Vega responded: "When you are good at what you do, money comes, people. Work hard and you'll be able to afford."A chorus of boos drowned him out.Inside the racks of clothes had been removed for the party, and what was surely the best-dressed audience ever to occupy 315 Bowery hobnobbed late into the night. Varvatos employees wore headsets, and staff for the event darted around in black T-shirts with "Birthplace of Punk" printed on back.Mr. Varvatos, 53, whose company has an estimated $80 million in annual sales and is owned by the $8.6 billion V. F. Corporation, said he expected some criticism but that he believed the store was respectful of the club's legacy."We're not trading on CB's at all," said Mr. Varvatos, whose stubbly looks and Detroit accent give him the aura of an ordinary rock fan made good. (He later corrected himself, saying: "Are we using the walls to help sell the clothes? Yes.") But he said that if he didn't take the space over, it was "probably going to be a different kind of commercial venture, whether it was going to be a bank or a deli."That seemed to be the consensus among the musicians on Thursday. "I'd rather see this than a Dunkin' Donuts or a Starbucks," said Jesse Malin of D Generation.Clem Burke of Blondie added: "It's better than if it was a Starbucks or a bank. This keeps some of the spirit of the place alive."Ernie Fritz, who is making a documentary about CBGB, expressed the ambivalence and perplexity many old-timers feel about the arrival of a luxury retailer whose shoes probably cost more than the Ramones' full wardrobe of ripped jeans."I wanted this to be a Duane Reade," he said, "because that's a clear enemy."An unscientific survey suggested that perhaps half the crowd had never been to CBGB, and though T-shirts with the club's logo had become a fashion trend around the time the club was closing down, few were visible on Thursday.Just inside the front door, where a tiny television monitor was playing videos of performances from the club, a few former CBGB employees stood together, eyeing the crowd and reminiscing. B. G. Hacker, who used to manage the club, said that Hilly Kristal, the club's founder, who fought to keep it open and died last year at 75, would have been happy to see the legacy preserved on the walls, at least.Liz Kurtzman, a former waitress and bartender, wasn't so sure."It doesn't smell the same," she said.NOW added to the endangered species list in New York City, along with independent booksellers and shoe repair: the neighborhood record store.The hole-in-the-wall specialty shops that have long made Lower Manhattan a destination for a particular kind of shopper have never made a great deal of money. But in recent years they have been hit hard by the usual music-industry woes — piracy, downloading — as well as rising real estate prices, leading to the sad but familiar scene of the emptied store with a note taped to the door.Some 3,100 record stores around the country have closed since 2003, according to the Almighty Institute of Music Retail, a market research firm. And that's not just the big boxes like the 89 Tower Records outlets that closed at the end of 2006; nearly half were independent shops. In Manhattan and Brooklyn at least 80 stores have shut down in the last five years.But the survivors aren't giving up just yet. Saturday is Record Store Day, presented by a consortium of independent stores and trade groups, with hundreds of retailers in the United States and some overseas cranking up the volume a bit to draw back customers and to celebrate the culture of buying, selling and debating CDs and vinyl.Among the highlights: Metallica will be greeting fans at Rasputin Music in Mountain View, Calif., and Regina Spektor is to perform at Sound Fix, a four-year-old shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that like many has learned to get creative, regularly offering free performances. At Other Music, a capital of underground music on East Fourth Street in Manhattan that faces a shuttered Tower Records, a roster of indie-rock stars will be playing D.J. all afternoon, including members of Tapes 'n Tapes, Grizzly Bear and Deerhunter.One-day-only record releases will also be part of the event. Vinyl singles by R.E.M., Death Cab for Cutie, Vampire Weekend, Stephen Malkmus and others are being sold on Saturday, and labels big and small are contributing sampler discs and other goodies. (Schedule and information: recordstoreday.com.)"Record stores as we know them are dying," said Josh Madell of Other Music. "On the other hand, there is still a space in the culture for what a record store does, being a hub of the music community and a place to find out about new music."Some retailers are hoping that the effort is not too late. Jammyland and the Downtown Music Gallery, two East Village institutions — Jammyland, on Third Street, specializes in rare reggae, and Downtown, on the Bowery, in avant-garde jazz and new music — are facing untenable rent increases and are looking for new homes.Jammyland is "the model of what a great record store can be," said Vivien Goldman, the author of "The Book of Exodus: The Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers' Album of the Century" and other books. "D.J.'s congregate there from all over and exchange ideas. It's a crucible of music knowledge."For a local music shopper with a memory of even just a few years, the East Village and the Lower East Side are quickly becoming a record-store graveyard. Across from Jammyland is the former home of Dance Tracks, a premier dance and electronic outlet, which closed late last year, as did Finyl Vinyl, on Sixth Street. Stooz on Seventh Street, Sonic Groove on Avenue B, Accidental on Avenue A, Wowsville on Second Avenue and Bate, an essential Latin store on Delancey Street — all gone, to say nothing of stores in other neighborhoods, like Midnight Records in Chelsea and NYCD on the Upper West Side."Rent is up, and sales are down," Malcolm Allen of Jammyland said as he sold a few Jamaican-made 45s to a customer last weekend. "Not a good combination."Like many longtime clerks, Mr. Allen is frighteningly knowledgeable. Testing out a random single on the store turntable, he discerned in a few seconds that it had the wrong label: it wasn't "Good Morning Dub," he said, but rather U-Roy's "Music Addict," from around 1987, itself a response to Horace Ferguson's "Sensi Addict." That earned him a quick sale,  and later research confirmed that he was right on the money.Casually dispensed expert knowledge like that is exactly what Record Store Day is looking to celebrate. Ms. Spektor, who started off selling homemade CDs and is now signed to a major label, Sire, said that independent stores had been the first to carry her music, and that their support helped her career take off. And though she said she now feels contrite that for years her music collection was made up mainly of items copied from friends — "I just had no money" — she is supporting the stores out of gratitude."I'm the record label-slash-store nightmare," Ms. Spektor said. "Everything I had was a mixtape or a burned CD. But I don't like the idea of all the record stores where people actually know what they're talking about going out of business. They have their own art form."Every year consumers buy less of their music in stores. According to Nielsen SoundScan, retail outlets accounted for 42 percent of album sales last year, down from 68 percent in 2001.To adapt, many stores are devoting more space to DVDs, clothes and electronics. That's the case even with the biggest retailers, including Virgin Megastore, which has 10 outlets in the United States. (It has closed 17 since 1999.) The company reported that last year its sales were up 11.5 percent. But nonmusic purchases accounted for the jump; music sales were flat. Simon Wright, chief executive of the Virgin Entertainment Group North America, said that over the last four or five years music sales had gone from being 70 percent of the stores' total to less than 40 percent."The sheer drop-off in the physical music market is going to inevitably cause the space allotted to music to come down," Mr. Wright said. "That will obviously contribute to further decline." He added that the future of Virgin's Union Square location was up in the air; though profitable, he said, the store is just too big for the current market.Whatever people buy there, the store is doing a brisk business. It buzzed with shoppers on Sunday afternoon. Some of them, like Kim Zeller, a 37-year-old clothing designer pushing a baby carriage, said that buying music on the Internet just can't compare to the experience of browsing in a store — and getting out of the house."It kind of gets boring when you're trapped inside listening to music from your computer," said Ms. Zeller, who had bought new CDs by Erykah Badu and the Black Keys. "I still like coming to the store."Although many have been shuttered, more than 2,400 independent shops still exist around the country. And even in the most gentrified parts of Manhattan, some are carrying on the same as ever. A-1 Records, on East Sixth Street, which has Polaroids out front of the D.J.'s who shop there, is still a popular trove of rare vinyl, as are the Academy outlet on East 12th Street, Record Runner and Strider on Jones Street, and the venerable House of Oldies on Carmine Street. The Academy store on West 18th Street has one of the most picked-over CD inventories in the city.Products that aren't fundamentally made up of ones and zeros — vinyl records, for instance, which have a habit of turning casual fans into collectors — have proved a salvation for many retailers. Eric Levin, the owner of Criminal Records in Atlanta and one of the organizers of Record Store Day, said vinyl accounted for a quarter of his music sales."That may only be a niche as we go forward," Mr. Levin said, "but it'll be a giant niche you can make a lot of money on."For many New York shops, however, the real estate crunch is making survival difficult. The Downtown Music Gallery, which sells about $60,000 in CDs, DVDs and other items every month, has been searching for a new home for six months, said Bruce Lee Gallanter, its founder. So far it hasn't been able to find anything affordable in its namesake area in Lower Manhattan and is considering moving to Queens, Brooklyn or Washington Heights."We would love to stay downtown," Mr. Gallanter said. "That's what we're all about. But we have to be realistic."COMEDYBAY SHORE Boulton Center for the Performing Arts Big Laughs in Bay Shore II, with Jim Mendrinos, Leighann Lord and Bob DiBuono.

Maybe Bonnie Raitt.Not that there's anything wrong with that. The predominantly white singer-songwriters who came to fame in the 1970s were among the first voices in popular culture to speak out on behalf of environmental concerns.But now Mr. Shapiro and the other organizers of this weekend's national Green Apple Festival, billed as the country's biggest Earth Day celebration, want to expand the audience. In trying to draw as many as 500,000 people to its main events  —  free concerts on Sunday afternoon in eight cities —  the festival is  reaching out to younger people and to demographic groups that have not traditionally been associated with the environmental movement.That means the Roots & Friends and Toots & the Maytals performing on the National Mall in Washington, along with Thievery Corporation and Gov't Mule. That means Menudo and Arrested Development in Bicentennial Park in Miami, and Los Lonely Boys and Junior Brown at Fair Park in Dallas. And improbably, perhaps,  that means the bluegrass and country star Ricky Skaggs  and his band, Kentucky Thunder, at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park."We made a conscious decision to cast a much wider net than most people would expect, in terms of booking the artists and genres this year," Mr. Shapiro, the event's executive producer and founder, said in an interview recently. "We think it's vital that the environmental movement appeal to what the country looks like today, and that meant bringing in R&B, reggae, country, hip-hop, world music."Or as Kathleen Rogers, president of Earth Day Network in Washington, put it: "We would have taken someone like James Taylor, but our real goal is to find groups that will bring out a younger and more diverse audience."In a bit of a twist, the biggest city, New York, will play host to the smallest of the Green Apple events. In addition to Ricky Skaggs, Big Head Todd & the Monsters, the South African singer Vusi Mahlasela and the Bacon Brothers, featuring the actor Kevin Bacon, are scheduled to perform. The city has been reluctant in recent years to allow major pop concerts on Central Park's bigger lawns; about 7,000 people are expected to stop by Rumsey Playfield, best known as home to the SummerStage concert series, for the event. That is less than 1 percent of the more than 750,000 people estimated to have flocked to the park in 1990 for the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.The main event is the mash-up scheduled for the steps of the Capitol in Washington, where Mr. Shapiro said the musical lineup would be accompanied by speakers scheduled to include Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader; Ed Norton, the actor; and Thomas L. Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times.This year is both a far cry and a direct spiritual descendant from the Green Apple concerts two years ago in New York, which Mr. Shapiro established with the publishers of Relix magazine as the first regular Earth Day music series. While dozens of bands played traditional club gigs under the festival's banner, the festival's free events culminated outside Grand Central Terminal with Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann of the Grateful Dead, and luminaries including Walter Cronkite. (This year's festival will also include more than 100 evening concerts nationwide,  including, in New York, Tea Leaf Green at the Highline Ballroom on Saturday and They Might Be Giants at Town Hall on Sunday.)"Pop culture has certainly propelled the environmental movement along, and that's even more true today because it's trendy, because it's in fashion," Mr. Hart, who is scheduled to perform on Sunday in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, said in a telephone interview last week. "Trying to reach the widest demographics seems like the right thing to do. I did it a few years ago in front of Grand Central on a flatbed truck,  and there beside me was Walter Cronkite on a drum. Talk about demographics."Propelled by expanding corporate sponsorship led by JPMorgan Chase, the festival grew to three cities  —  New York, Chicago and San Francisco — in 2007 before expanding to eight cities, including Denver and Los Angeles, this year.In one sense, the Green Apple concerts are an extension of a mission Mr. Shapiro began as owner of the famous downtown jam-band rock club the Wetlands Preserve, which he bought in 1996. The "Activism Center" Volkswagen microbus from the club is now enshrined at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland."I met Pete when he bought the Wetlands, and the Wetlands was one of the first clubs that really had a green agenda," said Warren Haynes, a guitarist for Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band. "This kind of green awareness usually starts with young people, and there was a time period where the younger generation for whatever reason had their heads somewhere else,  and now it feels like younger people are getting more involved in this issue again."For Kevin Wommack, manager of Los Lonely Boys, the Green Apple shows are an opportunity to raise environmental awareness among a Hispanic audience that has not traditionally been at the core of the green movement."With the huge Hispanic audience here, and with the boys being a Mexican-American band, this is just a great opportunity to make an impact with this group in terms of green consciousness," he said. "All it really takes is motivated people who want to connect the dots and move this forward to a different, broader base."ComedyTARRYTOWN Tarrytown Music Hall The Nobodies of Comedy.

He was 58 and lived in Manhattan.His death, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, was caused by melanoma, according to Mr. Springsteen's Web site, brucespringsteen.net.Mr. Federici was Mr. Springsteen's collaborator since they jammed together at clubs on the New Jersey shore in the 1960s. "He was the most wonderfully fluid keyboard player and a pure, natural musician," Mr. Springsteen said in a statement. "I loved him very much. We grew up together."Born  in Flemington, N.J., Mr. Federici began studying classical accordion at 7 before switching to electric organ and joining rock bands. He played at clubs in Asbury Park and made his first recording on a single by an Asbury Park songwriter, Bill Chinnock, whose bands included two other future members of the E Street Band: Vini Lopez on drums and Garry Tallent on bass.Mr. Federici and Mr. Lopez started their own band and invited Mr. Springsteen to become a member. "This skinny guy with long hair and a ratty T-shirt was an incredible guitar player and a good singer, so we asked him to join," Mr. Federici once said.The band was named Child and soon renamed Steel Mill, which built a strong reputation touring the East Coast. Mr. Federici was also in Mr. Springsteen's short-lived band Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.He did not play on Mr. Springsteen's debut album, "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.," from 1973, but he was in E Street when Mr. Springsteen introduced the band that year on "The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle."Mr. Federici remained in every E Street Band lineup, along with Mr. Tallent on bass and Clarence Clemons on saxophone, until taking a medical leave of absence in November 2007. Mr. Springsteen called him "one of the pillars of our sound."Like a gospel group, the E Street Band includes two keyboardists, one usually playing piano and the other an organ. Mr. Federici, whom Mr. Springsteen often introduced as "Phantom Dan," was the organist; he also played accordion for songs like "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)." His role in the band was most often supportive, filling out the harmony with beefy chords from his Hammond B-3 organ.But Mr. Federici is in the foreground with the organ solo on the 1980 hit "Hungry Heart." At times, to give the E Street Band its chiming, Phil Spector sound onstage, he played a keyboard-operated glockenspiel, one of few in existence.For much of the 1980s Mr. Springsteen kept the E Street Band on retainer while working with other musicians. Mr. Federici played on Mr. Springsteen's 1987 solo album, "Tunnel of Love," and was a member of its touring band. He was a studio musician on Mr. Springsteen's 1995 solo album, "The Ghost of Tom Joad." Through the years  he played recording sessions for Joan Armatrading, Garland Jeffreys, Graham Parker and Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, among others.Mr. Springsteen reconvened the E Street Band to record new songs on a greatest-hits album in 1995 and started touring with it again in 1999. "The Rising," Mr. Springsteen's 2002 record, was his first full album with the E Street Band since "Born in the U.S.A." in 1984. They have toured together often since its release.Mr. Federici, whose replacement after November 2007 was Charles Giordano, last performed with Mr. Springsteen and the band onstage in Indianapolis on March 20. They are still on tour, but have postponed some shows.Between E Street Band engagements, Mr. Federici led his own groups in clubs and released two albums of pop-jazz: "Flemington" in 1997 (reissued as "Danny Federici" in 2001) and "Sweet" in 2004 (reissued as "Out of a Dream" in 2005).He is survived by his wife, Maya; his son, Jason; and his daughters Madison and Harley.
