IN the nearly three years since the levees failed during Hurricane Katrina, you haven't had to wait very long at a Louisiana festival or nightclub before a singer croons, "What has happened down here is the winds have changed." That's the opening line of "Louisiana 1927," which has become the state's unofficial anthem in the wake of the 2005 tragedy. Written by Randy Newman in the mid-1970s about a flood that covered a good deal of Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana half a century earlier, the song climaxes with its plaintive, singalong chorus, "Loo-eez-ee-ann-a, they're tryin' to wash us away."The song's lament of being battered once by nature and again by a callous government had resonated with flood-ravaged audiences from New Orleans to Lake Charles well before 2005.  Then Katrina came, and Mr. Newman seemed downright clairvoyant. "For a long time after Katrina," said Marcia Ball, a Louisiana-born blues singer, "there just wasn't a dry eye in the house when I did that song." While Katrina inspired many songs, she said, this one became the anthem because it has "one of those simple, irresistible Randy Newman melodies and lyrics that were so real. In truth, so many people did get washed away.""Louisiana 1927" is more than an anthem, however; it's also a modern-day folk song that gains new lyrics as singers adapt it to new circumstances. Ms. Ball tweaked the lyrics for her 1997 version, which she will perform on Saturday at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Before the weekend is done, other interpretations of the song should also be sung by the Wild Magnolias, John Boutté and, in their first Jazzfest appearance since Katrina, the Neville Brothers. And on Thursday afternoon Mr. Newman himself will return to the festival to sing his original words."It's a New Orleans tradition that you can take any music and mess with it," said Bruce Boyd Raeburn, the curator of the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University. The key lyric is "They're tryin' to wash us away," he said, because it is applicable to most periods of New Orleans history. "It captures that feeling that you're trying to cling on to your culture, to your life, in the face of this wave of indifference, of racism, of malevolence and of water itself."Mr. Newman, 64, may be closely associated with his hometown, Los Angeles (he wrote the tongue-in-cheek tribute, "I Love L.A."), but he has roots in Louisiana. His mother grew up in New Orleans, and he lived there over several summers and while his father was in the Army during World War II. "There were these horrendous things — those signs with 'Colored' on one side and 'White' on the other," he said in a recent phone interview. "But I always loved the pop music. I was so influenced by Fats Domino that it's still hard for me to write a song that's not a New Orleans shuffle."His fascination with Louisiana led him to books about the state's legendary governor Huey Long, known as the Kingfish, who used the 1927 flood to stoke rural resentment against the big-city bosses and to win his first term the next year. As John M. Barry wrote in "Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America" (1997), the most powerful businessmen in New Orleans illegally dynamited levees to make sure the city stayed dry.Mr. Newman's research led to "Louisiana 1927" (as well as "Kingfish") on his 1975 album, "Good Old Boys" (Reprise). He delivered the story with an understated detachment, as if he were a hard-bitten newspaperman or a fatalistic farmer.Aaron Neville, who was born and raised in New Orleans, heard about the song from his frequent duet partner Linda Ronstadt, a longtime friend of Mr. Newman's. He recorded the tune for his 1991 album, "Warm Your Heart" (A&M), and his approach was anything but understated. Backed by an orchestra and a gospel choir, he sang with all the drama of someone standing in water up to his thighs. Because he has a much better vocal instrument than Mr. Newman, Mr. Neville could exploit the melodic rise of "Louisiana, Louisiana" in the chorus and the melodic collapse of "They're tryin' to wash us away." And because he was closely identified with New Orleans in a way that Mr. Newman never was, he gave that chorus a first-person authenticity."When I watched the Katrina coverage on CNN," he said, "I'd see people on the roofs that I knew. I said: 'Damn, when's the cavalry coming? The cavalry comes every time, why not now?' When I used to sing that song, it was about something that happened a long time ago. Now when I sing it, it's about something that happened to me and my family, so it's a lot more real." He predicts that "Louisiana 1927" will be the emotional peak of the Neville Brothers' festival-closing set on May 4.Gradually Mr. Neville's version of the song became a standard among the black residents of New Orleans. In 1996 Bo Dollis & the Wild Magnolias recorded "Louisiana 1927" for their album "1313 Hoodoo Street." The Wild Magnolias, who perform May 4 at Jazzfest, are Mardi Gras Indians, that New Orleans tradition of African-Americans who dress in elaborate costumes of feathers and beads. Mr. Dollis changed the lyrics to "River had busted clear down the canal line, six feet of water on the streets of the Lower Nine."That's a reference to the Lower Ninth Ward, the neighborhood that was famously demolished in Katrina but which also suffered serious flooding from Hurricane Betsy in 1965. Mr. Dollis had lived through Betsy, and he asked his band's manager, Glenn Gaines, help him write a new version about that flood. They even added a verse contrasting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with Vic Schiro, the city's segregationist mayor at the time. "Bo started describing to me how the water came through like a freight train, how in a matter of minutes people lost what they'd worked for their whole lives," Mr. Gaines said. "Of course, it was the poor black folks who suffered the most. That's why we put Martin Luther King in there."The Wild Magnolias' recording was the first hint that "Louisiana 1927" was becoming a folk song. And since Katrina the song has been recorded by Willie Nelson, the British folk singer Martin Simpson, the zydeco accordionist Terrance Simien, the R&B singer Howard Tate and the jam band the String Cheese Incident. Mr. Newman himself re-recorded the song with the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra for the post-Katrina benefit album "Our New Orleans 2005" (Nonesuch).But the song's most dramatic recasting was by Mr. Boutté during his memorable set at Jazzfest in 2006. Backed by horns and a rhythm section and wearing a straw hat with the front brim turned up, he sang Mr. Newman's lyrics straight through once, then changed things around. The line "Clouds roll in from the north" became "Clouds rolled in from the Gulf." The line "President Coolidge come down in a railroad train/with a little fat man with a notepad in his hand" became "President Bush flew over in an aeroplane/with about 12 fat men with double martinis in their hands.""The city had been empty, but the whole world would be coming for Jazzfest," Mr. Boutté recalled. "We'd have a soapbox to talk about our loss and about the unconcern others had for us. But I had to find the right song."His friend Paul Sanchez of the rock band Cowboy Mouth suggested "Louisiana 1927." As Mr. Boutté rehearsed it, he unconsciously changed "crackers" to "Creoles" and "what the river has done" to "what the levee has done." When they realized what was going on, the two men decided to rewrite the song.Mr. Boutté saved it for last at his Jazzfest set, and when he started dropping local references into the lyrics, older women rose from their plastic folding chairs, waving their hands over their heads and egging him on as if they were in church."First the women started crying," recalled Mr. Boutté, who performs at Jazzfest on Friday. "Then the men started crying. Then the children started crying because their parents were crying. Then I started crying. I can't sing that song too often because it takes too much out of me. It reminds me of the needless loss — and the loss never seems to end."SANTOGOLD(Downtown)Santogold's debut album makes some boasts that ought to come true. In her brightly glinting voice, Santi White declares, "I'm a creator/Thrill is to make it up/The rules I break got me a place up on the radar."Ms. White sings, yelps, hiccups, raps and toasts Jamaican-style on "Santogold," which bounces among genres like a well-flipped pinball. There are two takes of "You'll Find a Way": a pop-rock band version that starts with the backbeat and floating guitar of the Police before it gets all riled up, and a distorted, chopped-up electro track that's barely the same song. Those are only two of her guises.Santogold is the latest project by a songwriter who draws her pop sense from scattered sources. Back in 2001 Ms. White was the songwriter and executive producer for the debut album by Res, a neo-soul singer from Philadelphia. Then she led Stiffed, a band that reached back to brittle early-1980s hybrids of new wave and ska. She has just collaborated with the reality-show pop-rocker Ashlee Simpson for two songs on Ms. Simpson's new album.And now on "Santogold," abetted by the bassist John Hill from Stiffed, she harnesses all her predilections to the brash attitude of her current home, Brooklyn. Her new wave side is strongest, but only by a plurality.Ms. White applies Siouxsie Sioux's ululating vocals, by way of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, over the terse post-punk guitar and synthesizer of "L.E.S. Artistes," the bluesy swing of "My Superman" and the measured electronics of "Starstruck." She leans toward the Pixies in "I'm a Lady." She echoes another Brooklyn transplant, the rapping global provocateuse M.I.A. (who appears on the album), with agressive chants and electro riffs in "Creator" and "Unstoppable." And then there's her reggae-ska side in songs like "Say Aha" and "Shove It," in which  she insists, "We rough it up a bit/We broke but we rich enough."While Santogold's songs have an arty Brooklyn edge, they're proudly pop. The hooks are clear, and the choruses are full of singalong lines and nonsense syllables: "I got to be unstoppable/Ay ay ay ay!" Through all her riffs and rhythms Ms. White comes across as both a scrappy underdog and a girlish cheerleader for everyone who feels like one. JON PARELESPHIL VASSAR"Prayer of a Common Man"(Universal South)A bruiser with a tender touch at the piano, Phil Vassar has long been torn between sensitivity and machismo. On "Prayer of a Common Man," this versatile country singer's fourth album, the tug of war is over. The soft has it.Few in country focus on feelings quite as intently as Mr. Vassar, and hanging over the album is the specter of his recent divorce from his songwriter wife, Julie,  with whom he wrote two heartbreakers here, "It's Only Love" and "Let Me Love You Tonight." Though there are a couple of jubilant moments on a par with his mischievous 2004 hit "I'll Take That as a Yes (The Hot Tub Song)" — the 1950s swing of "Why Don't Ya," and the common-man lament "The World Is a Mess," which sounds transplanted from a Broadway stage — Mr. Vassar mostly finds ways to be wistful.But while he's an affable vocalist, he's not especially subtle. So there is the occasional disconnect between his often strong songwriting (he began his career as a writer, contributing to No. 1 country hits for stars like Tim McGraw and Alan Jackson) and his sometimes brusque delivery. "I Would," a crisp song about a relationship gone sour, would be better slowed down; "Around Here Somewhere" is elegantly constructed — "What's become of our two hearts?/Lately we just play the parts" — but it's disorientingly uptempo, a forced grin through pain.Following the generic guitar-driven arrangements that precede it, the warm piano on the pleading ballad "Let Me Love You Tonight" comes as a relief. Here Mr. Vassar flaunts his fluid way with melody — "You said it was easy/To be you with me/It's gonna hurt, believe me/But I'm gonna set you free" — and at the chorus he effortlessly skips up an octave. It's the hungriest moment on the album, and the calmest one too: it's when he's down that he's most at ease. JON CARAMANICA STANLEY JORDAN"State of Nature"(Mack Avenue)It has been more than a decade since the guitarist Stanley Jordan released a proper album. Mr. Jordan, one of the few jazz musicians with a gold record to his name ("Magic Touch," his 1985 Blue Note debut), has devoted most of that time to reflective pursuits like music therapy. His last specialty release was called "Relaxing Music for Difficult Situations, I."The temptation, then, is to consider "State of Nature" a return to jazz after some prodigal diversions. But the album is a true hybrid, splitting the difference between assertive post-bop combo work and gauzy New Age confabulations. Some of it is likely to drive jazz listeners crazy. Some of it simply wafts by. As a whole it hangs together because of the deep and obvious investment Mr. Jordan has in the music.His signature technique — a method of playing the guitar as a sort of orchestral percussion instrument, tapping the fretboard with the fingers of both hands — receives generous expression here. The album's sprawling opener, "A Place in Space," enables a virtuoso turn, as does the Antonio Carlos Jobim classic "Insensatez (How Insensitive)." And a solo interpretation of the F-major andante movement from Mozart's piano concerto No. 21 will surely grab the attention of amateur guitarists. (Watch for imitations on YouTube in the coming months.)For much of the album Mr. Jordan works with the bassist Charnett Moffet and the drummer David Haynes, who function as a supportive if somewhat generic rhythm team. And Mr. Jordan occasionally plays piano and guitar at the same time, soloing with one hand and chording with the other. This nifty trick yields wan results on a pair of overplayed jazz standards, "Song for My Father" and "All Blues." It works a bit better on an original, "Shadow Dance," that faintly evokes the sound of the Pat Metheny Group.Environmental awareness was apparently one motivating factor for Mr. Jordan on "State of Nature," and he duly includes tunes with titles like "Forest Garden" and "Prayer for the Sea." Somehow it all culminates in a smooth-jazz cover of the Joe Jackson disco hit "Steppin' Out." That phrase describes what Mr. Jordan is doing here, even if the results don't suggest risk so much as a kind of reassurance. NATE CHINENRAVEN-SYMONé(Hollywood Records)Though she's a Disney Channel star, Raven-Symoné will probably never release a sexy record to prove she's not a Mouseketeer — the way Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears did to prove they were all grown up. Instead this 22-year-old from Atlanta seems to age in reverse. Almost two decades  have passed since she played sassy Olivia Kendall on "The Cosby Show," lip-syncing to the bawdy blues anthem "I'm a Woman" on screen. But on her latest, upbeat pop album her voice is higher and more childlike than ever. "I'm a girl," she insists, "one hundred percent girl."Having built her empire on the tween sitcom "That's So Raven," Raven-Symoné is wise to work the angle that she's no different from any of her middle-school fans. One endearing song even finds her staring long-legged glamazons down and realizing "they put their shorts on just like me." But when the Clutch, Sean Garrett and other urban hit makers try to bring the Dirty South out of her, building beats around distorted synths and repetitive club hooks, Raven-Symoné comes across as stiffly G-rated. On 'Stupid," she tells her crush he's got what most "dames" want.When she manages to avoid the granny slang, she sounds confident on the R&B tracks. "In My Skin" (she feels comfortable in it) recalls early Janet Jackson. And mid-tempo ballads like "Hollywood Life" and "In the Pictures," about the loneliness of being a child star, feel heartfelt. They underscore that she still has a real-girl appeal — and the right producers to bring it out of her. MELISSA MAERZ AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRAZankel HallThe development of orchestral music has always been intermingled with technological advances, as a motley assemblage of instruments has evolved into a brilliant, versatile hybrid organism. But composers continue to dream up sounds that spark mutation. On Friday night at Zankel Hall, in a program titled "Playing It UNsafe," the American Composers Orchestra was equipped with enough wiring and circuitry to qualify as bionic."Additions," by Charles Mason, offered a nearly seamless integration of electronic and acoustic sounds foreshadowed by musicians in the lobby and CD players in the bathrooms. Jonathan Dawe used fractal geometry to distort themes from "Armide," a 1686 opera by Lully, which he reset in a futuristic postwar Iraq. The work in progress sounded chaotic and even strangely dated, despite attractive timbres that included the santur, a Persian hammered dulcimer.For "Tender Hooks" Anna Clyne fashioned a complex interdependency among Joshue Ott, a visual artist; Jeremy Flower, a computer musician; and the orchestra, with each component affecting the others. A bustling introduction conjured brilliantly flashing stellar phenomena, and a quieter passage suggested gossamer nebulae floating to serene woodwind lines.In Dan Trueman's appealing "Silicon/Carbon: An Anti-Concerto Grosso" members of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra used computers to manipulate sounds made by the acoustic ensemble while adding rhythmic patter and rubbed-goblet peals. The results sounded something like a shimmering moment from a John Adams orchestral score stretched out indefinitely.Ned McGowan, a composer and flutist, proved there's still plenty of life in old-fashioned virtuosity with "Bantammer Swing," a playful, athletic concerto for his unwieldy contrabass flute. Jeffrey Milarsky, the conductor, deserves immense credit for keeping a complex program running smoothly. STEVE SMITH PAVEL HAAS QUARTETWeill Recital HallLeos Janacek's career bloomed unusually late, and he was almost 70 when he wrote his String Quartet No. 1 ("Kreutzer Sonata"). The work had fine champions at Weill Recital Hall on Friday evening in the Pavel Haas Quartet, which has enjoyed success since its founding in 2002, collecting prizes and awards including this appearance in Carnegie Hall's Distinctive Debuts seriesBased in Prague, the group — Veronika Jaruskova and Maria Fuxova, violinists; Pavel Nikl, violist; and Peter Jarusek, cellist — is named after a Czech composer who perished in Auschwitz. Its empathy for Czech repertory was immediately apparent in its performance of the Janacek quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's novella "The Kreutzer Sonata."With full-blooded passion and finely nuanced playing, the young musicians conveyed the yearning of the opening Adagio, the urgency of its bittersweet motif and the ironic joviality of the second-movement polka. Ms. Jaruskova played the finale's violin solo, marked "like in tears," with soulful pathos.Tears were replaced by sunshine in Dvorak's smiling String Quartet No. 12 ("American"), played with graceful charm and lilting dynamic contrast, the second movement enhanced by Mr. Jarusek's voluptuous cello tone.The performance of Beethoven's String Quartet in A minor (Op. 132) suggested that the group needed a little more time to grow in this work. But its encore, the Largo from Smetana's String Quartet No. 1 ("From My Life"), was another showpiece for its tonal beauty and polish. VIVIEN SCHWEITZERThe next Distinctive Debuts recital is on Friday at Weill Recital Hall, with the violinist Christian Svarfvar and the pianist Anders Kilstrom; (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org.TAKACS QUARTETZankel HallLucid investigations of the standard repertory have earned the Takacs Quartet a sterling reputation, and a slightly rough-hewn, earthy quality that has emerged in recent performances has made the group even more compelling. The latest reminder came on Saturday night, when it completed a seasonlong survey of Haydn's Opus 74 quartets and the three string quartets of Brahms at Zankel Hall.Haydn, of course, is a dietary staple for any quartet; Brahms, if less ubiquitous, is hardly exotic. Much to the credit of these players, nothing sounded less than fully energized and committed on Saturday.Intensity and drama abounded in a lively account of Haydn's Quartet in G minor ("Rider"). Edward Dusinberre, the first violinist, sounded slightly strident at times but offered sweetly spun embellishments during the Largo.Brahms, usually branded a conservative, sounds like anything but in the Vivace of his Quartet No. 3 in B flat. The Takacs players sounded suitably impulsive in its mercurial shifts and rhythmic frictions. Geraldine Walther, the violist, brought a warm, throaty beauty to the Andante and was a strong protagonist in the subsequent Agitato. Karoly Schranz, the second violinist, and Andras Fejer, the cellist, contributed with dignity and heart.After intermission the suave pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet joined the quartet in Franck's Piano Quintet in F minor. Swept up in chromatic themes of surging romance, the players struck an ideal balance between rigor and abandon.

Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," in the operatic version by Ned Rorem, came to the Juilliard Opera Center on Wednesday night. Its just-folks serenity could only be American.There are no big people doing grand things in turn-of-the-20th-century Grover's Corners, U.S.A., nor are there little people doing violence to one another on the grand scale that opera expects. In "Our Town" getting up and having breakfast are events as major an any. It's not something Puccini would have understood.By definition "Our Town" is also about a place, not a set of principal singers, although in its rank-and-file of equals the lovers George and Emily are more equal than anybody else. Absent is the dramatic arc that takes stories and people from A to B. Here unfolding events are broken into pieces, rearranged out of order and frozen in time.Wilder's play and, happily, Mr. Rorem's setting of it are sweet-tempered without being sugar-coated. Death and the unhappinesses it leaves behind are as much topics as life and its small pleasures.Mr. Rorem's music builds on favorite hymns and sings with a familiar tunefulness subjected to touches of acid. The Juilliard Orchestra, conducted by Anne Manson, makes important use of the piano. Mr. Rorem's vocal style could possibly be described as one continuous horizontal flow, but I like to think of it as a series of closely connected, self-sufficient arias.Mr. Rorem does acknowledge grand opera by elevating the soprano role of Emily to something wide-ranging and declamatory. Jennifer Zetlan, who played the role at the Aspen Music Festival two years ago, sings beautifully and affectingly. The part could not be in better hands.Alex Mansoori (the Stage Manager) and Alek Shrader (George) are solid and convincing. The singing citizenry of Grover's Corners includes Marc Webster, Jessica Klein, David McFerrin, Renée Tatum, Julie Boulianne and Nicholas Bentivoglio.Edward Berkeley's direction adheres to the tone of simplicity that "Our Town" brings with it. John Kasarda's set is a deep, blank stage with straight-back chairs arranged and rearranged. The story of J. D. McClatchy's libretto is operatic in itself: Wilder didn't want his play as an opera, refusing applications by eminences like Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland. In 2001, the Wilder estate gave in.Mr. McClatchy rejiggers and condenses. He has to. Music and words move at different speeds, and when opera kowtows to original texts the results are usually fatal. Ask Verdi.POPFull reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB (Saturday and Sunday) Mark Eitzel's husky, weary voice holds the complete anatomy of melancholy, and his band, American Music Club, ranges through genres to flesh out his every bleak mood, from bristling cynicism to wistful ballad to folky introspection. Saturday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door.

(Jon Pareles)ATMOSPHERE (Sunday) Slug is the rapper, and Ant is the producer in Atmosphere, the hip-hop duo from Minneapolis. Once known as a producer of "emo rap," since Slug so thoroughly explored his insecurities and misgivings, Atmosphere has lately turned its attention to other people's lives, telling stories with hard-headed sympathy. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, websterhall.com; sold out. (Pareles)BUDOS BAND (Thursday) With its vintage-tweaked blend of horns, hand percussion and Farfisa organ, Budos Band earns its self-description as the paragon of "instrumental Staten Island Afro-soul." The group's dozen or so members land here on the heels of a European tour and share a bill with a Bulgarian-Balkan folk outfit, the Ivan Milev Band. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $14. (Nate Chinen)★ CROWDED HOUSE (Monday through Wednesday) On its first album in 13 years, "Time on Earth" (Capitol), which was released last summer, this mostly reunited band eases right back into the warm, Beatles-meets-new-wave melodies that animated its 1980s hits ("Don't Dream It's Over"). But a specter of mortality and frustration hangs over every lyric, suggesting that the group is still struggling to come to terms with the 2005 suicide of its original drummer, Paul Hester. With Don McGlashan. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $50. (Ben Sisario)EPMD/NAUGHTY BY NATURE (Friday) "The deal is that we're real so that we're still around," Naughty by Nature rapped in "Hip Hop Hooray" back in 1993. Younger rappers have all but replaced hip-hop's 1980s and 1990s generation on recordings and charts, but the old rhymes and beats still sound confident and quick-witted on the concert circuit. The duo EPMD  arrived from Long Island in the late 1980s with boasts delivered in calm monotones over bare-bones samples, a sound that would influence gangsta rap. Naughty by Nature, faster-talking rappers from New Jersey, segued wildly free-associative rhymes with chant-along choruses. Also on the bill: Lords of the Underground, from Newark. At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 930-1950, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35. (Pareles)★ FEIST (Tuesday and Wednesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the indie-arty scene with delicious, breathy songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness. That ubiquitous iPod commercial didn't hurt, either ("1 2 3 4"). With Hayden. At 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario)★ FIERY FURNACES (Saturday) The brother-sister duo of Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger, a k a the Fiery Furnaces, makes a species of indie-rock that defies explication, categorization and most standards of comprehension. On their current tour the two have been upholding the principles of "Democ-Rock," through songs written in collaboration with their perceptive fans. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Chinen)FILM SCHOOL/MAHOGANY (Thursday) Shoe-gazer rock lives on in the eddying, enveloping guitar drones and sullenly wistful songs of Film School, a band that sounds English but hails from San Francisco. Mahogany, from New York City, also loves drones, but creates them through precise patterns: sometimes by way of post-punk rock and Stereolab, sometimes in closer to ethereal Minimalist compositions. With Soundproof and Elika. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12.

(Sisario)HATE ETERNAL/SOILENT GREEN (Monday) Hate Eternal makes Florida death-metal — fast, pulverizing, armored, airless. Soilent Green, from Louisiana, is just as loud but less structured: the band has been known to get into slower tempos, making a more organic and downcast kind of music. At 7 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $14 in advance, $16 on Monday.

(Sisario)THE KILLS (Thursday) Following in a long tradition of arch blues-punks, this American-British, male-female duo surrounds sexy, corrosive riffs with no shortage of sneers and pouts, romanticizing the eternal pursuit of trashy chic: "I'm bored of cheap and cheerful," sings Alison Mosshart, a k a V V, "I want expensive sadness." With Child Ballads and Telepathe. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)HABIB KOITE (Thursday) This guitarist and singer from Mali fingerpicks modal, hypnotic songs that are steeped in griot traditions yet well aware of the outside world. On acoustic guitar he is both folky and otherworldly; on electric guitar he has a rocker's drive. He's bringing his band Bamada. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $25.

At 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $30. (Ratliff)MINISTRY/MESHUGGAH (Thursday) Al Jourgensen's band Ministry has been bashing out its provocations and frustrations, political and social, since 1981, in the noisy place where metal and industrial rock intersect. It's going out with a bang in what's billed as its final world tour. Sharing the bill is Meshuggah, the unstoppable Swedish thrash band whose high-speed songs flaunt the complexities of math-rock. At 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $55; $60 on Thursday. (Pareles)MONOTONIX (Friday) The existence of Monotonix answers one pressing question: Yes, they apparently do have grungy, MC5-like garage-rock in Tel Aviv. With When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, Ruined Frame and Lidia Stone. At 8 p.m., Death by Audio, 49 South Second Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com;  $7. (Sisario)MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO IN ARTHUR AND THE COOPERS (Monday) Meshell Ndegeocello, the ever-experimental songwriter, bassist and lover of funk, jazz, rock and improvisation, unveils a mysterious new group whose only assurance is that it won't be playing any of her old songs. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15 in advance, $17 on Monday. (Pareles)MARK OLSON/JENNY SCHEINMAN (Wednesday) Since parting ways with his band the Jayhawks more than a decade ago, Mr. Olson has taken an even more rustic path; his most recent album, "The Salvation Blues" (Hacktone), has a modest, sweetly yearning sound. Ms. Scheinman, who opens, is a violinist with a forthcoming singer-songwriter record of her own. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Chinen)120 DAYS (Monday) This Norwegian quartet — which includes three keyboardists — adds rock 'n' roll thrust and considerable gloom to the perpetual-motion techno of Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. The band plays the Mercury Lounge on its way home from Coachella. With School of Seven Bells. At 9:30 p.m., 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.(Sisario)DOLLY PARTON (Thursday) Her new album, "Backwoods Barbie," is modeled on the sound of new mainstream country, and recently she made a string of bluegrass records, but Dolly Parton, at 62, is a pop star in the widest and most general sense; she's aiming at anyone who has caught a glimpse of her over the years. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $49.50 to $100. (Ratliff)JOSH RITTER (Sunday and Monday) A guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of Josh Ritter's songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. At 9 p.m., with the Proclivities on Sunday, and Langhorne Slim, a songwriter who styles himself as a hobo troubadour, on Monday; the Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $20 (sold out on Monday). Langhorne Slim also celebrates his new, self-titled album on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario)PAUL SIMON (Friday through Sunday) Two-thirds of Paul Simon's three-part retrospective were devoted to his 1980s and 1990s forays into African, Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Caribbean. That leaves a huge catalog of "American Tunes" dating back to the 1960s: folky, jazzy, poetic, catchy and quietly complicated pop songs to be revisited by Mr. Simon, along with the popera singer Josh Groban, the sibling harmonizers in the Roches, the old-timey revivalist Gillian Welch, the dreamily harmonizing indie-rock band Grizzly Bear and the down-home jazz trumpeter Olu Dara. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4139, bam.org; sold out. (Pareles)LUCIANA SOUZA (Wednesday) Throughout her recent release, "The New Bossa Nova" (Verve), Ms. Souza, an astute Brazilian-born singer, imbues adult contemporary pop standards with a style-specific lilt. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.(Chinen)THIRD EYE BLIND (Tuesday and Wednesday) Hugely successful in the late '90s — its song "Semi-Charmed Life" was inescapable for a year or so — Third Eye Blind faded and became something like just another modern-rock band. Working toward a new record ("Ursa Major") in 2008, its first album in five years, the group has been playing new songs on the road. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $35. (Ratliff)URGE OVERKILL (Tuesday) Inactive for a while in the first few years of the new century, but now reunited, this Chicago band has long been figuring out how to make noisy college-rock popular. It hit it big for a minute in 1994, when Quentin Tarantino used its version of Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon" in "Pulp Fiction." At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $17 in advance, $20 on Tuesday. (Ratliff)VAN HUNT (Tuesday) On "The Popular Machine," a digital EP released last year, this determinedly eclectic R&B singer ventured another amalgamation of lascivious funk, simmering soul and flinty guitar rock. The effort's shortcomings were all too evident — his label, Blue Note, opted not to release a subsequent full-length album — but that doesn't lessen the dynamic potential of Van Hunt's live show, with D.J. King James and the singer-songwriter Shae Fiol. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 on Tuesday. (Chinen)WAS (NOT WAS) (Thursday) Smart alecks from Detroit who love funk, David Weiss (a k a David Was) and Don Fagenson (a k a Don Was) started Was (Not Was) in 1980 with the soul singers Harry Bowens and Sweet Pea Atkinson. They made four albums of sometimes absurd, sometimes politically minded funk, then dissolved; Don Was went on to produce albums for Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and many others. Reunited for a new album, "Boo!" (Rykodisc), they're still twisting soul and funk behind their own tales of lust, larceny, murder and existential dread. At 8:30 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $28.50 to $34. (Pareles)ZEMOG EL GALLO BUENO (Friday) Zemog is Gomez backward; the band, led by Abraham Gomez-Delgado, pushes the mambo, bomba and plena he grew up on in Puerto Rico toward the squall of Sun Ra's free jazz. At 10 p.m., Drom, 85 Avenue A, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, East Village, (212) 777-1157, dromnyc.com; $10. (Pareles)
